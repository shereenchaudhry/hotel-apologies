When we arrived to our surprise the room was ready & we were able to check-in. The front desk staff were mediocre gave us 1 key for 3 people & sent us on our way. The room was very clean I noticed that right away but the room was on the small side but very modern. Two of the workers were extremely nice. There was a young women at the reception desk she had glasses & blond hair I didn't catch her name, she always smiled and waved when ever we came in & out the hotel. I meet one of the maintenance men Shakeem I asked him where could I go to get ice and he told me the 3rd floor and he also told me all the amenities the hotel offers. He showed me the fabulous lounge on the 2nd floor and told me where the gym was located. I was stunned I thought I would‚Äôve gotten told these things as I was checking in. Anytime I saw him he asked if we were ok & did we need anything. He even showed me on my map all the places I needed to go. Overall the location was great, awesome views from the room! Bar had good drinks but very dull atmosphere. Didn‚Äôt get to taste the food but it‚Äôs good you do offer breakfast. I love the fact that you need your room key to enter the building at night. I can see myself staying here again. I do appreciate the customer service I received from Shakeem & the young lady at the reception.","Dear Alisunshine20,Welcome to New York City and thank you for choosing us to be your hotel to experience the city for the first time.

I've tried for (2) months to get this resolved, they've had me like a ping pong ball going back n forth spending hours of my day on the phone speaking to and emailing different reps both onsite Hotel and Marriot customer service line. The end result, I was never refunded what I was overcharged much less no one had the courtesy of getting back after all my attempts to reach out and get some answers.

Total cost inclusive of 3 nights, taxes & fees $505.31. (Cant beat those rates thus I booked immediately)To my surprise when I checked out, the next day what I was charged on my bank card was $794.98! ($289.67 over rates offered) When I called the Hotel directly I was told ""We're sorry as we are unable to apply the AAA discount now that you have checked out of our Hotel""SERIOUSLY?

Then we arrived this week for our first overnight stay. First and foremost, you need to know that the south side of the hotel is right next to the T. So, all the even numbered rooms are ""track-side"". Also, the lower the number, the closer to the tracks the room will be. So, we were given room 202, the closest to the T tracks you can get. The T runs until about midnight, then starts again around 5:30 AM, and once it gets started, there are many, many trains. For $300/night, guests deserve better!The second important thing visitors should be aware of in advance is the $40/night valet charge for parking. There is virtually no alternative to park elsewhere in the area since most parking spots are for residents. There are a few overnight meters where you can park from 8PM to 8AM, but the only ones I know are several blocks away on Beacon Street, so you need to wait to park your car after 8:00PM and then be sure to get back to the spot to take your car out the next morning before 8:00.These two major issue aside, the hotel is new and clean, and the rooms are a nice size with a roomy bath (at least in our room). Each room has a self contained HVAC unit that is a bit on the noisy side. So, if you want to get to sleep in peace, set the thermostat low before bed, then bump it back up to the temperature you want overnight as you climb into bed.

The rooms were a bit too modern for me (no carpets, minimal lighting, not much furniture to sit on) but they were very clean and spacious. However, the price we paid was high, given that it is very noisy room. The hotel is directly across the street from a D line T stop and the end of the line C. So we hear squeaky subways constantly, late hours of the night while trying to fall asleep and early hours of morning. Maybe they run all night, I don't know.Also there is no place to walk around. If you want the location to hop right on the T, then it's good, otherwise, pass for a hotel with a better and quieter location.Also felt with the $40 parking added to the room it was a bit pricy total. No real lobby or common area and no good furniture in the rooms (too minimal and modern to be comfortable after a long day)","Dear Michele,We appreciate the comments regarding your recent stay at our property in Cleveland Circle.Sorry you did not enjoy the modern style of the property and European decor.

We booked 4 rooms for 2 nights each. The first night one person in our group talked to management concerning the price of the room. She gave him a discount and told him to not tell the other people in the group because she would not give anyone else in the group a discount. The group found out the evening of the second night. When I spoke to the manager, Allie, about the price it was apparent that she had made up her mind to not work with the group. She told me that she had told the one Male member of our group of 8 not to tell he had gotten a discount because she wouldn't be giving a discount to anyone else. We booked as a group, we should have all paid the same amount. I also brought up that the price was $70 cheaper online though travel sites per night. So not only did she favor one out of the four rooms, she also made it apparent that no one should ever book through the hotel, instead book through a travel site. Very poor business model to make people that book through the hotel and book ahead of time pay more than someone who books online where another company takes a cut of what the customer pays. The manager, Allie, told us that we should have cancelled our reservation and booked through the travel site if we wanted a better price. Horrible customer service. Smaller issues being no breakfast included for almost $260 a night, smelly hallways, stingy on the complementary items in the room (one bottle of water for a room with double beds- when asked for another they offered to sell me one), and not good service at the bar in the lobby. The dangerous part is the elevators. One of the members of our grouo was trying to hold the elevator door for another and the doors did not want to stay open. While she was standing in the way of one side of the door, it started making a beeping noise and began closing, pushing her towards the other side of the closing door, luckily she was able to stay on her feet and dive out before the doors closed on her. Extremely dangerous! What if she would have fallen and been unable to get out of the way in time?? Overall, do not book here! Go literally next door to Element or up the street to the Westin...anywhere else!","Dear happyhourhopper....I am sorry that your experience at our hotel proved so difficult. As it relates to the questions regarding rate, we adhere to an industry leading best available rate program by booking direct with our hotel website. That does not mean that prices do not fluctuate over time for all hotels. If a leader decided to make an adjustment in good faith for a guest, this does not influence pricing on additional rooms, but I am happy to connect with you personally to discuss further at Christy.loy@starwoodhotels.com. Thank you also for making us aware of your concern regarding the elevators during your recent visit. The elevators are designed to respond to the door hold button open button for an extended period or to respond to motion.

The check-in desk is a circular island close to the entrance doors to a cavernous lobby. Upon arrival there was a queue of guests waiting to check in (only two clerks on duty). This queue impeded entry to and exit from the hotel. Upon checking in we were advised there would be no water available the following morning from 09:00 until noon as there had been a mains burst and City Water were undertaking repairs. Though this was obviously not the fault of the hotel, the clerk kindly offered us two complimentary drinks at the bar. (Though this did not eventuate as he couldn't find any vouchers).The bar is open to the very noisy lobby. I've seen better in an airport departure hall. The 'restaurant' was in another corner of the lobby and comprised a hot drink vending machine, fridges with frozen ready meals, a microwave, shelves with canned drinks and packets of snacks. I've seen better in a backpackers.The bedroom was nicely decorated, spacious and had a king size bed. Bathroom and shower perfectly adequate. Fridge and in room safe available. Good number of power points for recharging your electronic devices. The aircon unit was almost of industrial size - emitting a strong blast of air, very noisy and hard to regulate.When my wife tried to make coffee in the coffee maker, upon pouring water into the reservoir it turned milky (I guess the previous guests had poured milk into the reservoir to make a latte). Anyway, she refused to use the machine, not knowing what substance was in the reservoir. We rang room service and they supplied a replacement machine.The hotel is situated in an industrial desert, overlooking truck yards and shipping container storage. (See attached view from the bedroom). Boston Seaport is undergoing rapid development - I'm sure the area will be vibrant in about 15 years. The nearest bar is adjacent to The Westin about 10 mins walk down deserted D Street. The nearest restaurant is a small counter-top eatery about 5 mins down D Street.","Dear Gaijin-Tanuki‚Ä¶thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

12,27,21.0,30.0,,,,,,,,,,,apologyWhenselectingthehot,Aloft Boston Seaport District,30,"When selecting the hotel, the property's web site made the location sound as if it was in the center of activity. In reality, it is located in a quiet, industrial part of Boston near the convention center. There are very few restaurants with a short walk and no shops and services. The breakfast was not great, so it is worth going elsewhere. The staff were uniformly friendly and helpful and the rooms were large and comfortable. For a property that is a little more than a year old, however, the air conditioning units were noisy and hard to control, so I ended up shutting it off most of the time. The first room I was given had exposed pipes with a loud drip, so I requested and was given a different room. If you are using the convention center, it is not a bad choice. If you prefer a central, convenient area, this is not the place.","Thank you for your review of the Aloft Boston Seaport. Our neighborhood is already thriving with restaurants and attractions and with all the development, it‚Äôs quickly becoming a superb location that will soon rival that of the Back Bay or Theater District. I apologize for the issues you encountered with the heating/AC unit and appreciate your bringing it to our attention.

The location was perfect for what we needed (proximity to family - otherwise we would have stayed in midtown). It served its purpose. But the bed was so hard that I could not sleep well. The mattress is comparable to a futon mattress. But the room is configured well for such a small space.Be prepared to grab a bag of ice on the way up, there are no ice machines on the floor. The coffee in the lobby was really good!My only complaint besides the bed was that the staff don't have any uniform or name tags which makes it pretty sketchy. How do I know they are legitimate employees? One had on jeans and construction boots and it just screamed unprofessional to me.I doubt I'd stay here again, but thats my personal preference, because I do prefer the hotels in midtown.

It was pretty disgusting! The cleaning was not done properly for who knows how long. I first noticed the inside of the shower door had marks when it fogged up -- male splatter marks. I'm a female and I def know that was not from me! They had complimentary body wash (white) and shampoo in the shower in pumps attached to the wall. All I can think about was the body wash probably has some other junk mixed in. UGH! Ok...then I was in bed and kept thinking about the gross shower and if I should call to change rooms because I then noticed male splatter marks ALL OVER THE WALLS!!!! I mean I don't know the housekeeping protocol, but wiping down walls should be done. I do admit if you were busy and didn't really look or pay attention you wouldn't notice. But once I saw one mark, I saw them ALL. Whoever was in that room had a hay day. I just wished it was cleaned up!!! During check in, lady was extremely nice to people ahead of me -- giving them coupons and complimentary breakfast coupons. Once I got to her, I did not receive any coupons or complimentary anything! And I had to wait twice as long because she was talking too much and apologizing for the wait to the other people! Oh Well...Location to Columbia is OK and within walking distance. It is uphill so be prepared for a trek! NYPD is close and there is a nice park nearby. Seemed safe, I was able to walk everywhere day and night. Just please train your cleaning staff to clean and disinfect the insides of the showers from top to bottom!!!

We waited until 5:15pm, to get a room, and only got a room because we complained about the wait. We had plans to go to a concert that night and due to the very late check in, we missed our dinner reservation. The shower was missing a glass door, which got the entire bathroom wet. They wouldn't help us out in any way except to wave their $26 parking fee. By the way, the parking garage was small and filled up. We called the hotel and was put on hold for 15 mins, I hung up and then we had to double park and block someone in just so I could talk to the staff. When we finally got to our room, it was OK, not worth the $280 we paid. I regret my trip there, we would have been better off at the Best Western or the Holiday Inn across the street. Rude staff, and I would not recommend to anyone. There are many better places to get a hotel in LA, and when we checked out they tried to charge us for parking, when they said it was waved, had to argue again with the staff.

38,21,-20.0,7.0,,,,,,,,,,,apologyOnOctober192018I,Best Western Plus Hobby Airport Inn & Suites,20,"On October 19, 2018, I flew into Houston from Chicago intending to catch another plane out to Oklahoma City, as luck would have it, the Chicago flight was delayed and I missed the connecting flight. I was also without my suitcase as it had been checked to go on to OK City. I called the hotel, and having already been warned by my daughter that they might not accept my debit card with my husband's name on it, I explained this to the clerk answering the phone. She stated no problem and I'll send a shuttle over, please go to area 14 pick up. I was relieved to arrive as I had been suffering from vertigo and had hurt my knee trying to race through the airport. Patricia was the desk clerk, when I gave her the debit card, she told me I could not check in because my husband wasn't present. I called my husband and he phoned corporate where we have a credit card on file as we are members of the reward program. Corporate called the desk and spoke to Patricia indicating that she should accept me, she told them no it wasn't the policy of the hotel. My plane landed at 8:oo pm and I stood there offering cash to no avail, after three calls from corporate and starting to call my other business friends to tell them to avoid this hotel, Patricia finally said she would accept cash....originally she had quoted me $78 but now it was $98 plus $100 deposit. I paid it. She knew I did not even have my suitcase with me, but she never even offered a complimentary toothbrush. After going to my room at 10:54pm, I grabbed my coin purse and headed back down to see if I could buy one. When I stepped outside my door, I could hear Patricia directly below me complaining about me to other employees. There were none for sale in the sundries area so I returned to the desk and asked another young lady for a toothbrush and she gave me one. I returned to my room and ordered Dominos pizza delivery, and finally got to eat supper at midnight! This is not the Texas hospitality that I knew as a child growing up in the state! The room was clean and comfortable, but the hospitality was totally lacking! The next morning I left at 7 am, and was not given a receipt for my stay. I did not eat the breakfast offered because I felt so very unwelcome. Never again!!!","Dear guest,I definitely understand that you were already in distress you due your flight being cancelled. I also agree with you that you felt my staff had to have more compassion for you in the situation you were in. However, Patricia, did follow all policies in place to insure our credit card member safety and security are in place since there was no way of really knowing who was the card holder since he was not present at the time. I am truly sorry that you felt that we were uninviting to you during your short stay here with us. As always we would love to have you stay with us.Till then please be safe.Flo Vega",Trip type: Traveled solo,Date of stay: October 2018,"Response from Best Western Pl...

40,21,30.0,30.0,14.0,30.0,30.0,,,,,,,,apologyWestayedheretwosep,Best Western Plus Hobby Airport Inn & Suites,30,"We stayed here two separate nights on this trip. AAA has them rated 3 stars which is about right in our opinion. Good pricing with discount compared to some others nearby.Pros - Staff friendly. Great free breakfast with scrambled eggs and waffles. New renovations. Excellent fitness room. Very close to Hobby airport and car rentals. Note: don't use Hertz, poor experience there with staff, pricing, poor customer processes/flow, and trying to charge us for existing damage. We normally use Enterprise and will not use Hertz again. We took a drive east to Galveston Bay in LaPorte where there was a nice beach and pier since we had a few hours of free time.Cons - Our first night, the first room we were assigned 124 had a strong musty damp smell that didn't go away even after two hours with windows open and AC on while we were at dinner. They readily moved us to a 2nd floor suite which smelled much better. That room was very nice but was not quite done with reno work. Our second night's stay there we were given room 216 which had the same smell but not quite as strong. We aired it out while at dinner which helped too. Could not find the source of the smell. Reno- it's obvious they have tried to do a great job with the work and upgrades. Some of the finish work is not done well so it is not going to wear well and already seeing problems, like paint coming off the bathroom door. There are no restaurants in walking distance. We had to drive quite a ways to find something that was decent.Recommendation - if you are looking for value and don't mind the possibility of what we experienced it's not a bad place. The smell was really the only big issue for us.","Dear Guest,Thank You for taking the time to review our hotel and pointing out ways we can improve.

I‚Äôve used Best Western for my travels for over 10 years and never had a bad experience until I visited the West Hollywood location on sunset. The manager or receptions Frank was absolutely rude and ignorant. We had reservations and were simply checking in so we parked out front and this guy named frank came running at us saying we can‚Äôt park here and made a big scene until he figured out we had a room booked. My kids were frightened from his tone and gestures. The stay after that started horribly we weren‚Äôt getting any customer service at all. Every time we would call for room service we would either be put on a long hold or no response. Would definitely not recommend this place until they change their staff. The only nicest person was the maintenance/janitor guy. I should‚Äôve booked room at the Andaz hotel instead.,We are sorry that we let you and your family down. Each of our staff members strive to provide excellent service and we apologize for not meeting your expectations.

Personally I wouldn‚Äôt say this hotel is good value for money except for its location.The hotel initially looks like it is tired and could do with some work being done. We got to our room in the evening, it was very dark and in the corner of the hotel which gave us the feeling of being in dungeons. We then moved room due to leaking air con, the second room was poolside and a lot bigger so suited us more. However, air con was still not working properly. After calling reception we were told somebody would come look at it however nobody ever came.Breakfast is very good but is served with paper plates and plastic cutlery.

We were there for a family visit and knew we wouldn't be in the room a lot, so was looking for value this trip rather than an experience. Thank goodness as the stay was a C rather than an A. Our room was on the inside of the property that surrounded the pool. As we were trying to go to sleep after a long trip from the East coast, I thought we had mistakenly rented a cot at the water park - the rooms literally open up to the pool deck so imagine the fun being had by children under age 10 four feet from your bed. Also, the hotel must be pet-friendly - as most things are in LA - as on the other side of the wall a dog was barking off and on throughout the night and morning. The room itself was okay. Clean and that's about it. Front desk staff was hit or miss - friendly or literally not there or disinterested. Will not return.","Thank you for choosing our hotel for your trip to Los Angeles.

Besides upscale hotels that were out of our price range, the Blvd Hotel and Spa was the least expensive (if you call $250/night less expensive) than the Sheraton and others. We expected a lot more for what we paid. The walls were paper thin and we were able to hear long-winded conversations both next door and down the hall. And the parking was terrible. It was the type of parking where you have to pull your card forward in a 2-car bumper to bumper parking space and hope that when you leave the car in back of you is gone. They said that if your car was the outside car, that you're supposed to leave your car keys with the staff so they can move the other car so you can leave. In theory that may work, but on the day we left, there were 2 young ladies waiting to leave and no one knew whose car was in back of them. Thankfully, we found one of only a couple of one car only spaces and didn't have any problem. And on top of that, parking was $20 per night. Won't be staying there again!","Hi Pennie_Wilhelm,We appreciate you taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us. Thank you for your honest review.

This hotel was the only one in the area with an indoor pool - kids wanted to swim, but November is too cold for us to swim outdoors! The pool was perfect - small, but heated like a big bathtub. The location was very close to Universal Studios, which was convenient. The hotel is modern and trendy - many young people staying here. The bar/lounge downstairs had happy hour which was popular. Overall it was a fine experience, but some cons especially with the pool - the main reason we chose this hotel. The pool hours were incorrectly listed in the printed materials (other guests told us was wrong on the web as well) as closing at 7:00 PM - glad we asked for clarification and were told 10:00 PM - otherwise we would have assumed we missed swim hours and wouldn't have tried to swim on a couple of evenings. The pool door was locked 3 of the 4 times we tried, and no access with room key. Had to walk all the way back to the lobby (through the chilly parking garage) to get someone to open the door. Towels not always stocked poolside. And the pool area was pretty drab and depressing - painted grey like the parking garage, with some broken windows. Could use some blue paint on the walls like in the rooms, and some better attention to this area. Final complaint was that my bill at checkout did not reflect the rate I was quoted during my reservation. Had I not asked for a final printout, and also had a printed copy of the emailed reservation, I would have been charged $50 more per night, and more tax. And I think everyone would complain about $28 per day parking fee. That stings. We would probably go back in a similar situation, but if swimming during colder weather is not a priority then there are lots of other nearby hotels I would try first.","Thank you for staying with us chrisfCA.

I asked where to park my car and it was almost an imposition for me to be asking. The room was nice, but no coffee pot in it. You had to go to the fourth floor for coffee & their continental breakfast..the room had 4 tables, very tiny & extremely hot. Couldn't really move around in it with 10 other people in there. We stayed 3 days & they were suppose to pay for parking.. Right! Only one day of parking..got ripped off! Also, they have smoking rooms here & they can not guarantee you get one when you make the reservation either. You have to pay for Wi-fi..it's not free!! There are much better places to stay in NYC..that have more amenities to offer. This place was a disappointment.","We are very sorry to hear you were disappointed and we did not meet your expectations. We were rather surprised by your comments as most guests are extremely happy with our service and the amenities we offer. Our staff is normally very accommodating and we have a long standing reputation of offering warm and friendly customer service so we apologize once again if you feel you were not provided that. That is not the norm.We do offer a complimentary continental breakfast each day (most hotels do not) and 24 hour fresh ground Starbucks coffee and Lipton tea each day in our 4th floor lounge. The machine is rather large and not feasible to have one in each room thus the centralized location. We understand the lounge is rather small with limited seating but provide the fresh fruit, juices. muffins, pastries and bagels with cream cheese on a complimentary basis as we think our guests appreciate the extra value we offer. We know it is far from perfect but are just trying to offer a better value and guests can always take the food back to their rooms with the trays we provide or out with them when going on their day.We were a bit confused by your comment about parking as the hotel does not pay or ever offered to pay for parking at any time. Parking is in a public lot 1 block from the hotel and we are actually able to get our guests a discounted rate of $35 when it would normally cost $50 so it is a 30% savings.Again, our sincere apologies for not meeting your expectations as your experience was not typical and we hope you would be willing to give us another chance. If interested, please contact the General Manager, Scott Walker at 212-679-7665 and he will personally take care of your next reservation. We hope to have you back with us again.

At 11:00 pm on Thanksgiving Day, we were getting ready to go to bed and I noticed that there were blood stains on both the bed comforter and bed sheet. I called the front desk to express my concern and disappointment and was told that they would care of it. Well, after an hour went by, I called the front desk again to express my deep dissatisfaction and was told that clean sheets were on their way. They arrived 10 minutes later; however, it was not their staff's intent to strip the bed and put on new sheets. They expected me to do that and look bewildered when I expressed my displeasure. So, I changed the sheets and comforter myself. When I checked out of the hotel at 11:00 am on November 27, I waited for the front desk clerk to say something. Unfortunately, she said nothing until I once again mentioned what had happened to which she said ""Oh yes, I'm sorry about that."" So, I will never stay at the Broadway Plaza again because their quality control is lacking, their staff training is either poor or non-existent, and they don't understand what a true apology means (It is more than saying your sorry!) It is amazing to me that an organization doing business in the hospitality sector where ever dime of the customer's spend is discretionary, doesn't understand the firs thing about service recovery. After all, any organization can excel in the customer's eyes when things go well; however, the real test of an organization is being able to recover in front of the customer when things do not go well. The Broadway Plaza failed big time!",We were very shocked and disappointed to see your comments as this is not the type nor level of customer service we typically offer. Obviously we dropped the ball badly. One of the hotel managers has already contacted you and apologized profusely on behalf of the hotel as well as gave a discount for this stay and a discount on your next stay. We take your comments very seriously and have already spoken to all appropriate staff members on how this should have been handled so nothing like this ever happens again. We hope you will give us another chance to redeem ourselves and stay with us again to show you our normal standard of warm and efficient customer service which obviously you did not receive.

The proximity to subway lines (NQR) as well as (1) was very nice. As others have mentioned the breakfast room is small with around 3-4 tables, you will have to take items back to your room. Hotel has ice and vending only on 7th floor. Elevator went out one day during our stay however they were able to get this resolved. We never felt unsafe at any time as there is a heavy police presence every few blocks and there are police cameras everywhere. Doormen are very helpful with getting a cab if necessary. I would like to caution that you should be prepared for the street vendors if you will be walking Broadway to Time Square or the Flatiron area. These are guys that are standing around along Broadway and they are all selling some variety of handbags, watches, cologne etc. It does get annoying quickly. Lots of Bars in the area. The immediate food options are limited to room service or the Pizza place next door. You would need to go further down Broadway or 5th Avenue for other variety.

62,30,30.0,29.0,29.0,,,,,,,,,,apology1,Cambria Hotel Boston Downtown,20,"I stayed at this hotel recently and was very disappointed.First, I went to check in a few hours after the stated check in time of 3pm and the woman (who was rather hard to understand as she spoke very softly) said my room was not ready. When I asked for a time frame ie should I go have dinner or could I sit and wait for 10-20 min she would not/ could not tell me. I was really looking forward to freshening up. I found it very unprofessional that she did not even seem to care. Which was also the attitude of the doormen/valet no hellos or politeness.Then when I finally went to the room to go to the bathroom there was a specific kind of hairs on the toilet seat and dust everywhere . I have never had that happen especially in a new hotel thank god i bring antibacterial wipes with me. Plus the sheets were very itchy and did not feel like they had been washed.To me it seems like they should have waited to open and check everything / train staff before having guests then all of this could have been avoided. I understand things happen but there should be some kind of protocol/professionalism.

Overall, the hotel is stylish and attractive, and its location across the street from the Broadway T station is hard to beat. We also had a very reasonable room rate. But there were several shortcomings that kept us from rating this property higher.PROS:-- Appealing contemporary design-- Easy access to public transportation-- Several good dining options in neighborhood-- Comfortable bed, spacious shower, and large-screen televisionCONS:-- The room was small, and there was no place to put any baggage (no luggage stand or rack), also no shelves or drawers (just hangers), making unpacking options very limited.-- The room had not been vacuumed prior to our check-in, nor was it vacuumed during our 3-night stay.-- The room was not serviced following our first night.-- Following our second night, the housekeeping staff removed a partial roll of toilet paper but did not replace it, and there was no spare roll, so we had to call the front desk for toilet paper. (Most hotels have toilet paper on the dispenser and at least one additional spare roll in the room.)-- Both check-in and check-out were less than efficient (although friendly).-- $50/night parking charge is steep.Other minor technical issues, like incorrectly coded key cards, a loose shower gasket seal, a loose/warped door panel covering the HVAC unit, and one of the elevators temporarily out of commission did not help.The hotel would certainly merit a rating of at least 4 were it not for these minor and easily addressed problems.","Dear JJ,Thank you for your review and for staying with us recently. We too would like you to have the most pleasant experience possible and we always appreciate the feedback. We're happy to hear that you enjoyed our location and you were able to walk to many of the locations you needed to visit.Regarding the shortcomings, I am very sorry to hear about the lack of housekeeping service and the less than efficient check in and check out.

NO WAY!Rooms are ok, most people who work here are fine. Management, tho, clearly does not care: they 'provide' amenities (e.g. free Wi-Fi, Room Service, Breakfast buffet, etc), so the list of amenities looks good; but VERY insufficiently provided. Miami is a big place - much better options available. Specific examples:- The room cards provided upon check-in did not work, so had to go back down to check-in desk to get them fixed. The 'fixed' cards did not work so had to return back down. They couldn't activate the cards. After a few minutes of trying, they finally found some papers on their desk, which 'enlightened' them apparently that the room was not available. Asked them what the reason was, and they just ignored my question, sneering at each other.With a scowl on her face, one of the attendants studied her computer monitor for a couple of minutes and told me they had another room on the first floor. Told her I don't like first floors. After a couple of more minutes, they found a room on the 2nd floor. Check-in all in all took almost 30 minutes.- Room service menu is available in the room. But when I called them, they said I had to come downstairs to pick up the food as they don't have anybody to deliver to the rooms.- Breakfast buffet: They have several warming buffet canisters, but all empty. This is at around 7:30am on a weekday. No spoons; only fork and knife.- Wi-Fi is free, which is great. However, it kept getting disconnected, so had to log back on and on.- Morning of my checkout, they slid the statement thru under my door, like most hotels do. But the statement only showed -0- charge. So I went downstairs early morning to get a full statement, though i was not quite ready to check out yet, as I wanted to avoid a line later. The attendant told me I had to come back when I was checking out. So when I went back to check out, of course, there was a line.I must say I am now beginning to doubt the reliability of the Trip Advisor ratings. What I know for certain is I will never ever stay at a Cambria, Miami or elsewhere.","Dear Nekotamachan,Thank you for taking the time to fill out a review regarding your recent stay with us.

The nightly room rate does not reflect a discounted price, however. There is no restaurant in the hotel itself but there is access to the one next door.

Well, for the service and staff wise, they are all nice and friendly, I will definitely compliment them , especially Karlo the one who check us in and the other 2 lady at the front desk which we can't remember the name. Room and location is also good as it is just couple of blocks away from Times Square and near to pharmacy and restaurants. But the major disappointment is they don't clean the room, even just touch it up for a bit or even change towels. We need to request for it couple of times and keep it the used ones with us up to the end of stay as they don't really provide any housekeeping services, also there is a bathtub but the sink cover doesn't really close well, so it's impossible for the tub to be filled in with water. I just don't think that the price is worth of what you're paying. Also, we have not been informed about the rate difference (day-to-day) upon making the reservation. Overall, it is still an experience and from that we learn. Just not a place for us, I guess!","Dear mademoiselle_happees,Thanks for bringing your concern to my attention.

The hotel is less than 2 blocks away from the the Jackson CTA subway station, which means a traveler can board a train at O'Hare and get off in downtown Chicago just a short walk from the hotel -- no changing trains required. The hotel also has an excellent business/work area just below the lobby that has both Macs and PC computers, coffee, juice and light munchies.As for negatives, the basic rooms at this hotel are underwhelming. The rooms are small, the beds are substandard, and the WiFi marginal at best.For those who don't care about cost, the Central Loop Hotel will likely be a disappointment.

Unfortunately, it turned out that it was through another platform and when I arrived they were unable to provide a lesser rate. Because of the huge cancellation fee, I stayed there. Arrived up to my room on the 4th floor which is really tiny. Window faces into a brick wall. Nothing they can do about that. No hand towels or wash clothes. Had to get them to fix drain in tub as it wasn't draining. No secondary safety lock on the doors. If you decide to stay there I'd advise a rubber doorstop. Room was clean but the hotel needs upkeep.

The staff was pleasant and helpful; yet they didn't have any advil/tylenol at the front desk or any place to purchase at the hotel. The rooms were nice yet really small, especially the bathroom which could use an up grade in the shower (4 star hotel?). Pluses were the tv which was loaded with channels, apps etc., coffee maker and a chilled water dispensor on every floor (very nice addition to our stay). Negative was the King bed - its was actually two twins together which we found out the next morning as we ended up in the fold between the two; extremely limited lounge when it comes to purchasing things (coffee/expresso machine provided).Parking is provided for $16per day down the street at 75 Devonshire, the Elephant restaurant is nice, cool decor and accessable through the hotel.","Thank you for your stay and feedback doogha.

101,-20,12.0,1.0,15.0,-20.0,,,,,,,,,apologyWellletsstartwith,Comfort Inn & Suites Seattle,20,"Well, let's start with the good. MUCH cheaper than the $250-$300 a night wanted in downtown Seattle. Quick drive out of downtown. Fast check in and out. The front desk clerk at check in was very professional and helpful. That is about it for the good. So the bad. Parking lot is very tight. Parking in the garage is laughable if you own anything other than a very small car and the lot is not much better. The foyer is small but adequate. Hallways are dated as well as the rooms. Our room had an interesting aroma to it. Comments ranged from smells like salsa, to mildew, to just plain weird--can't identify it. Did not go away our entire stay. The room was big enough, but not clean enough. There were visible stains on the couch, chair and carpet. I am not sure the sheets had been changed on either bed, even though the beds were comfy enough. There were stains on the sheets. There was active mold growing on the caulk in the bathroom. The bathtub faucet leaked the entire time we were there and the water pressure was lacking. Breakfast was a joke. There were the standard breakfast items, except most of them were not stocked and did not see anyone restocking anything. Hot tub was ok, not busy.

It is a very, very strong sweet smell which seems to be covering up the smell of something else. It was so bad in our first room we asked to change rooms the next day. The next room smelled worse. When I went and told the gentleman at the check in he said it must be because I am a woman that the smell bothered me. I let him know that the smell also bothered my husband and kids. The next day I wanted our sheets changed because of some dirt on the pillow cases. It was clear they didn't change the sheets because the same dirt was still on the pillow cases after our room was cleaned. Also the water pressure in the shower was extremely low and the temperature of the water was either extremely hot or cool. The location isn't good either.

The sheets had dirty brown spots all over and toothpaste slung all over the bathroom walls. Our room was noisy with a family of five small children next door. Our phone rang four times during the first hour we were there requesting pizza, room service, and two calls from other guests.After kindly requesting another room, we were placed on another floor. This room was NO better. The beds did not have mattress pads and the fitted sheets kept popping off the corners exposing the blood stained mattresses. The sheets were NOT clean. Black hair was all over the tub. Two coffee mugs clearly had been used as coffee stains and black hair were in both. The lounge chair had a huge brown stain and on the backside and the cushion had a gigantic rip in the upholstery. Black mold appeared in the bathroom floor and the entire room had a strange odor.The key cards for both rooms did not work and staff appeared unconcerned. The local health department should be contacted regarding the cleanliness of the breakfast service. The lousy breakfast room was too small and guests were constantly bumping into one another.

The car park had been recently resurfaced which gave a fresh look to the exterior.The interior was however a little dated but at first glance around fit for purpose. When we went to the room which was at the rear of the hotel we were greeted with the sound of a train in close proximity to the bedroom window. To say it was noisy was an understatement and these trains run at least every 30 minutes to 11Pm at night. Add to that the Ice machine, lift and noisy AC units and you have the perfect storm.if you are a light sleeper you have no chance because of the lack of solidarity in it's structure. For those guests who can put up with noise it provides a free shuttle to the subway into Boston. Free breakfast was also a bonus in a small area off the reception area and coffee was always available at no cost.In summary I have travelled to many parts of the world and this hotel for me rates as one of the worst but of course we all have different levels of expectation and for me it gave no real rest and or ""Comfort""","Petroni, thank you for your thoughts.

That being said, the staff were incredibly nice. The best feature about the room, by far, was the bed. With 4 soft pillows, the firmness of the bed was great, the linens were soft and clean. Even the towels/wash clothes smelled nice--it was a very light fragrance but having stayed in budget hotels before, I thought the linens and towels were definitely a step up from regular budget hotels. The towels were also soft! The two things that kept me from giving this place a higher ranking was a dried water spot on the ceiling (there had clearly been a leak at some point) and the tv reception--some channels were all static, as in, you could see a picture but it was full of static and the channel guide provided in the room didn't match entirely to the actual channels. Parking is free--you get a parking pass to put in you car. There are some walkable places to eat nearby, including a grocery store across the street. Given the signs in the hotel parking lot to remove all valuables from your car and the same reminder given on the parking pass, I'm not sure I'd walk to the local places at night but that being said, I didn't hear any loud noise throughout the night so those warnings may just be common sense warnings. There is a $4.95/night charge added at check-in, it's supposed to be for phone/telecommunications, or something like that. I find it a bit bogus since I have a cell phone and had no intention of using the phone in my room but, it's $5 which is not worth an argument to me. I went down for breakfast just after 9:30 and found it to be well-stocked. There were 3 cereal options, 2 milk options, waffle maker, etc. I didn't use the shuttle service but I liked that they had a shuttle schedule and a subway map available in the lobby. According to the sign, the last shuttle officially left/picked up at 11pm but there was a note to see the staff if you needed a later pick-up. I stayed here because it was a few minutes away from the JFK presidential library & museum. If you're looking for a place to stay outside the city, consider this Comfort Inn. Room suggestion: Get a room that faces the front parking lot, the metro runs behind the hotel so I imagine rooms on that side hear the train every time it goes by.","Dear carmineruby, thank you for taking the time to share such a detailed review with us.

We had a rental car the whole time and we pick this hotel for it has free parking and it is easy to drive here to Key West, Everglades etc. There is absolutely nothing to do in the neighbourhood of this hotel. You can not jog or walk there just for fun. Every morning we left after breakfast and came straigh to bed, not a second too early. Some mornings breakfast was overcrowded and there was nothing to eat but bread. I could not get my morning tea since hot water in thermos was always luke warm.Room is spacious. A/C is too loud. Micro we did not use. Bathroom amenities lack hand soap as well as shower gel. Bath tub is useless unless you are a child. Whole floor is carpeted so it is not suitable if you have allergies. Beds are okay, not too hard. Coin laundry and dryers take only quarters. You can not open any window in a room and that is a huge minus. Nearby roard are very busy any time of a day so you will need earplugs to sleep. Plus the door to corridor is not soundproof.We did not have almost any contact with the staff. Housekeeping was friendly as was maintenance too. I had pleasure to meet manager Tulio only when checking out.

The hotel was clean and quiet. The room had a microwave, refrigerator, safe, and even a whirlpool. The hotel was conveniently located near Florida International University, where I was meeting a client and some students. I slept comfortably and the breakfast was okay. The staff was courteous but not as concerned or empathetic as I would have liked. (I'll explain) I woke up the next morning searching for my phone. I figured it had fallen through the crack of the mattress and the headboard. I reached down to discover all types of hidden treasures (not really). First I pulled up an old remote, which lead me to believe that they do not normally check the head of the beds because the room had a new remote. Next, I touched something that felt like satin. I immediately pulled the bed back and to my disgust I found a pair of panties (I would upload a picture but I don't want to offend anyone. I have one available by request.) How gross was that? I informed the hotel staff and they didn't seem the least bit alarmed or concerned. One of the receptionist even made an excuse saying the the cleaning person probably couldn't move the bed. I informed her that I, a very petite lady who barely weighs 120 lbs, had no trouble moving it so I don't see anyone else having a problem. She offered to send someone to clean the room, but I informed her I was checking out in a couple of hours so it was unnecessary. It kind of left a bad taste in my mouth. I kept thinking: 1) the room should've been thoroughly examined upon my arrival and 2) what if the person wearing those underwear last was infected by something. What offended me most is I have yet to receive a formal apology. I liked the hotel up until that point. Hopefully, your experience much more pleasant.","Hello Ms. B S,First, please allow me to apologize for what happened during your stay with us, I assure you steps have been taken to ensure that this does not happen again, to you or anyone else.Please know that a letter of apology was sent to the address on record (GA) on 02/10/2012.We are grateful that you stayed with us and hope that on your next trip to Miami you will give us an opportunity to host you again.",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: February 2012,"Response from ToolsMiami, Manager at Comfort Suites Miami / Kendall","Responded Feb 20, 2012",84,62.04,99.0,52.86,99.0,84.0,7.14,88.1,57.14,23.81,15.48,2.38,4.76,8.33,0.0,0.0,8.33,3.57,16.67,7.14,2.38,2.38,1.19,17.86,1.19,0.0,1.19,4.76,0.0,7.14,7.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.43,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.52,1.19,1.19,1.19,3.57,1.19,3.57,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.1,5.95,2.38,3.57,2.38,0.0,7.14,9.52,2.38,15.48,5.95,5.95,5.95,0.0,0.0,1.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.19,0,1.19,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.29,4.76,4.76,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.38,2.38,30.6,0.9080459770114941,1.43264367816092,1.514022988505747,320.8400212384209,600.6018293471973,6.13,3.22,7.72,-0.1671125,0.1108661305648737,0.2228053012637047,0.1399832297125492,0.2770805077799222,0.4172043105780336,-0.3926727272727272,0.32912,0.1751895598780707,0.2313981878730867,0.4013869902539456,0.4155909090909091,0.5771818181818184,0.7081363636363636,0.02298850574712644,0.0,0.0,0.03448275862068965,0.08045977011494253,7,30.0,True,Choice

After a long day of travel, then running in a downpour, we were cold, wet and tire, and the bright warm lobby was a welcome haven. Ever so softly in the background, Bing Crosby sang ""I'll Be Home for Christmas."" The desk clerk, Justin, treated us with a hushed courteousness that reinforced the pleasure of arriving at a small quiet hotel. I peeked into the breakfast room off the lobby, and imagined enjoying coffee and the morning paper at one of the little tables.Our room on the 8th floor was thoughtfully appointed with great lighting, good mattress and high-quality bedding.We were shocked in the morning to find the lobby transformed into a harsh, mindless, irritating space. Rock music was cranking and three TVs flashed and muttered on the walls. One older couple sat eating, sullen, not talking, music pelting them from overhead.The corporate goal must be to keep guests miserable in the public spaces. We love visiting Boston, and will be looking for a hotel that allows us to enjoy a quiet breakfast before starting the day.","Thank you so much for your review.

The people at the counter and the bell clerk were amazing. :) That I have to say. However, we were really disappointed that we had to ask for a fridge, ask for a safe, and ask to have our tvs fixed once in our room. At that, there were no fridges left and the safe we'd personally have to pick up. Considering we paid around $400/night during our trip to Boston for this year's marathon, we were disappointed. It seems these things would come standard at a typical hotel - let alone a Marriott. We hope that they'll make changes going forward. Marriott is normally such a GREAT hotel to stay with and our chain of choice. This was the first time we'd been disappointed. :)","Dear Jenny,We are delighted to hear your experience with our front office team was amazing.

120,3,16.0,30.0,-30.0,,,,,,,,,,apologyIstayedrecentlyfor,Courtyard Boston Downtown,30,"I stayed recently for several nights while in town for a convention. When I checked in, I was given room 701, and it was so tiny!! Boston was part of a multi-state, multi-occasion trip for me, which meant I was traveling with significant luggage. The first room was so tiny that I was going to barely be able to walk around in the room. So I went to the front desk and asked if they had any larger rooms. They were nice to try and accommodate my request. They ended up moving me (for a bit more $$) into room 910, which was much, much larger! I had plenty of room in that one. But I looked on the ""map"" of the rooms (near the elevator), and most of the rooms looked closer to the super small size of 701 versus the larger one.The bathroom was fine but had no fan and the light switch was in a weird location.Probably the best part about the stay was the tea tree shampoo and conditioner in the shower.","Dear Maserk,Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey. Your honest opinion goes a long way into helping us improve ourselves so that we can better care for our cherished guests. Our hotel building, built in the 1920s does have that old-timey architecture on most of our floors, leading to some very cozy-sized rooms. With that struggle that we have here at the Courtyard Boston Downtown, we do our best to boast the beautiful spaces accessible to all of our guests, including our 15th floor lounge space with complimentary water, our Elk's Room located right by the main entrance to our lobby, and our 5th floor event areas.While we do encourage these spaces, I can still understand how our cozy rooms do not appeal to everyone. I do hope that we can have the chance to impress you in the future, there are other rooms in our hotel that would have some more space to your liking. If you are not opposed to a room with 2 beds, we have wonderful corner rooms with more space, and we also have our 15th floor executive level, where all of the rooms are of a more recent construction than the 1920s rooms that we have on the floors below it. The next time you would like to stay in Boston, please consider us again and I will be happy to give you a complementary upgrade to one of these rooms. Just reach out to me whenever you book with us next.With Warm Regards,Cristina M",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: May 2019,"Response from BOSDMAGM, Manager at Courtyard Boston Downtown","Responded May 30, 2019",261,67.59,99.0,72.13,99.0,32.62,12.26,89.27,55.17,18.77,14.18,1.53,9.58,3.07,0.0,0.0,4.6,5.75,15.33,8.43,4.21,3.45,0.77,11.11,5.75,3.07,1.15,0.77,3.07,8.05,7.66,0.38,0.38,0.0,0.0,16.09,0.0,1.15,0.0,0.0,7.66,0.77,0.77,1.53,2.68,1.15,1.92,0.77,0.38,0.0,0.38,0.38,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.38,14.56,10.73,1.53,2.3,1.53,0.0,0.0,10.34,1.15,21.84,1.15,16.09,4.98,1.53,1.53,3.83,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.96,3.45,5.36,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.0,0.38,0.0,0.0,99.2,1.163548387096774,1.803799283154122,1.886487455197132,327.8703561179999,588.8211848962286,5.138999999999999,2.987,7.259,0.0569031007751938,0.1396540276120003,0.2434305139116384,0.2017206182609434,0.2049751101752274,0.2923611513542896,-0.2856206896551724,0.336711267605634,0.1213875486258742,0.1957560983036727,0.2806125136727853,0.3987684210526317,0.554084210526316,0.6958842105263158,0.01433691756272401,0.0,0.0,0.0896057347670251,0.02867383512544803,4,4.75,True,Marriot
122,-30,-20.0,-21.0,,,,,,,,,,,apologyOnApril29Ibooked,Courtyard Boston Downtown/North Station,10,"On April 29, I booked a 4-day vacation for myself and my son in Boston with Marriott via their 800 phone number for June 1st-4th. I am a Marriott rewards member for over 20 years and do some business and pleasure trips at their facilities. I applied my points which gave me the first night free. The other two nights were to be $322/night as per the customer service rep. I was given a confirmation number but was not emailed any kind of confirmation. I was emailed prior to my stay to let me know I didn‚Äôt have sufficient points to cover my stay but was well aware of that. When I arrived with my son I was told by Thy at the Front Desk that Monday nights rate was $617, almost double the rate I was confirmed for. I asked how that could be since I made my reservation back in April. I was told that because of demand and overbooking the rate was that amount. I was dumbfounded! I‚Äôd never book a stay anywhere out of town without knowing the price. How could they not honor a confirmed reservation? I got no help from the hotel so called the 800 number. They couldn‚Äôt/wouldn‚Äôt due anything to reduce the rate for Monday night. They made mention about the Stanley Cup Playoffs. The TD Bank Garden is right across the street but there were no hockey games till Thursday night. They said it would take 48 hours to resolve so I couldn‚Äôt take the chance and get billed for $617 for the last night. Unfortunately, we had to cancel out Monday night and make it a 3-day vacation. I feel this was outright price gouging along with horrible customer service. Megan at the front desk was supposed to give me a call within 48 hours after I arrived to look into it and didn‚Äôt. After I called on Monday to square away the bill I was told it would only be charged for the extra night and not charged for the first night with points. This would take 5-7 business days to resolve. The whole experience left a bad taste in my mouth with Marriott. Being in sales for over 30 years I still can‚Äôt imagine a company treating a Rewards member, let alone any customer, this way. Booker beware!","Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. It's never easy to read when a guests stay has been anything other than perfect. Unfortunately if you were not able to acquire the correct number of points required to stay with us, despite being emailed ahead of time, at property level we are left with the need to charge the prevailing rate of the day for the reservation. In these instances, we very much hope that the guest will communicate with us prior to arrival so that we may take steps to help however we can to get your reservation set up the way you prefer, offering the opportunity to purchase whatever points may be needed to satisfy the full stay ahead of time, so that a higher rate can be avoided. Given that the night you had opted to use your points happened to coincide with a Stanley Cup play off game, demand and rates became high across the city and the prevailing rate was not what you had expected. We hope to be able to discuss this further with you at a time of your convenience by telephone or email and would kindly ask that you reach out directly.",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: June 2019,"Response from CourtyardNS, General Manager at Courtyard Boston Downtown/North Station","Responded Jun 11, 2019",204,86.68,97.18,26.08,90.49,34.0,16.18,89.71,57.35,15.2,9.31,0.0,3.92,5.39,0.0,0.0,5.88,8.33,19.12,8.82,2.94,4.41,1.47,17.16,3.43,1.47,1.47,0.0,0.49,5.88,4.9,0.98,0.49,0.0,0.0,15.2,0.0,0.98,0.0,0.0,11.76,0.98,0.49,3.92,3.43,1.96,3.92,0.98,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.24,5.88,2.94,2.45,2.94,0.49,5.88,10.29,3.92,16.18,2.45,9.31,5.88,0.98,0.98,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.37,2.94,2.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.49,0.0,0.0,78.5,1.273271889400922,1.948663594470047,1.996912442396314,309.8064014908375,595.3246316356353,3.464,2.21,5.358000000000001,-0.01896634615384616,0.166635302217156,0.2504455151886589,0.1401873686875817,0.2323554424543074,0.3175639309403246,-0.2817570093457943,0.2594356435643566,0.2075683471617409,0.1617374862824262,0.2292084529854979,0.4206829268292686,0.5565731707317074,0.6681951219512197,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.03686635944700461,0.05069124423963134,3,-23.666666666666668,False,Marriot

That is good and bad. The bad thing is that the decor is dated and the furniture are worn. The good thing is that you can still get the old fashion breakfast buffet with omelette station. For frequent travelers: there is no VIP room and there is no free breakfast. They discontinued free breakfast this summer. Apparently there is no room upgrade either - I was sent to the disabled room next to the noisy ice mashine and elevator without prior warning as Platinum Elite..so your status doesnt buy you anything at this place. Rooms are as dated as the lobby...comes with the poor Courtyard bedding as any other CM. Only positive thing about the room is that they have the upgraded shampoo. TVs are smaller than normal. The pool is big enough to take a bath..not much more you can do in it..hot tub is luke warm...staff is soso...lots of minumum wage and the dressed up ones are friendly but somewhat ""uncool""..must be a very strict and micromanaged place.

We are Gold members and have stayed in Marriotts around the world. We were immediately disappointed. We were not at all recognized, waited 15 minutes to check in, and none of our requests were made (high floor away from elevator) we were on the 8th floor and right next to the elevator.We contacted the manger and were moved, but that was a HUGE mistake.Beginning at 9pm the room above us began to party and this continued until after 3am! It was so loud we have not slept at all. Several calls were made throughout the night and the hotel staff told us they had been to the room three times, but they could not get the guests to be quiet. This is absolutely unacceptable. Why were these guests not removed?! Apparently This hotel has zero concern for guest quality or satisfaction. If you expect any rest or any quality this is not a place to stay.We have one more night to stay here and can't begin to imagine the frustration that is going to go into it after last night.Save your time, money, and frustration and don't stay here.

I have not problem with this practice. however, no one wants to come back to there room in the late afternoon and see that housekeeping did not lock the door behind them and kept the lock extended to keep the door open. Luckily no one entered the room and stole anything. First I looked all over the hotel floor to see if maybe they were around in another nearby room. I could not find anyone from housekeeping on the floor. When I went down to the front desk, the front desk attendant showed little concern and just calmly stated ""I will let housekeeping know"".Rooms: Rooms are extremely small compared to most other courtyards. Also, there are little tiny gnats flying around the rooms that are annoying to say the least. I was travelling with a group of family members so I had the opportunity to be in several rooms on several different floors, all rooms had the same gnat problemsBathrooms: Again extremely small, virtually no counter space to set your overnight toiletries bag(s). If you are traveling as a single then the room size won't be an issue but be advise any more than 2 to a room will be uncomfortable.Amenities: Most courtyard's offer Starbuck's in the bistro along with other food and beverage items. While I don't like the Bistro concept Marriott has gone to it is a good alternative to no restaurant at all. Anyway, in every single courtyard I have stayed in, other than the Coconut Grove property, there is usually house brand coffee and ice water available in the lobby for guests. this property had no coffee for guests. With the prices this courtyard charges compared to other courtyards I would expect a little extra, but not here.Pool: the pool area is a plus for the hotel. The pool, is nice, it is clean and there are ample chairs. the one thing the management should do is to ask guests not to bring bottles near the pool. Every day I witnessed people bringing bottled beers to the deck area. This is very dangerous and the hotel should make it clear with a sign that no bottles allow in pool area.This same review will be forwarded to Marriott customer service. I realize they can't do anything about the room size, but issues with housekeeping, lack of services etc. should be acknowledged.Will not stay here again. Sorry there are too many other properties","Thank you for the feedback.

The location is decent...walking distance to Bayfront Park in the downtown area. Decent food options all over.The hotel is nice enough when you enter. Nice lobby with a little sundry store with snacks and such. The staff really shines...nice, nice people. They helped us with places to eat, did my laundry, got us cabs...all the stuff they are supposed to do, but with a smile on their faces.We ate in the restaurant/bar one late night and it was fair. Took quite a while to get the food, and was kind of expensive for what we got (club sandwich and fries) but what do you really expect from a hotel bar?The room was in some ways good, and in some ways bad.The good...HUGE room. King size bed, flat screen TV, a sitting area with couch and chair, work desk with nice chair and even some leftover room to spare. It really is probably the largest 'non-suite' room I have stayed in. I have stayed in Jr Suites in other locations that weren't this large.The bad...everything was just really old. They are in dire need of a make over. The furnishings looked old and very tired...the curtains were stained, and the carpet was wearing in places. The shower was old-looking, but great water pressure! I wanted to take a picture, but the toilet was REALLY ODD. It was set at an angle in the corner of the bathroom. It just looked really weird. Functional, though.Over-all with a little spit and polish this could be a really nice property, especially with the quality staff already in place and a downtown location that is near the airport, but not right on it.",Thank you for your comments!,Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: December 2015,"Response from Mariana S, Director of Operations at Courtyard Miami Downtown Brickell Area","Responded Jan 13, 2016",5,52.71,99.0,1.0,99.0,5.0,20.0,100.0,60.0,40.0,40.0,0.0,0.0,40.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,60.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.5,0.5549999999999999,1.148333333333333,1.295,314.3950726624,600.8105240699999,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.07766666666666663,0.1602978597155348,0.0612061972041799,0.2521539773276985,0.0531119526947725,0.836226378981366,-0.5056666666666666,0.3503333333333333,0.0,0.110407500523138,0.166457301454994,0.353,0.526,0.958,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.3333333333333333,5,-29.0,False,Marriot

Generally speaking we've had no issues with this hotel and have been willing to pay the inflated fee during the event every year.This year we booked our reservation through Expedia (as we have every other year) at a rate of $400/night. Obviously, this accounted for the inflated price during the event as their normal rate is in the mid$100s.Upon arriving at the hotel this year, we were informed that our reservation was somehow ""lost"". The manager proceeded to inform us that ""coincidentally"" there was one room left at a rate of over $600/NIGHT!!!! Let that sink in... OVER $600 A NIGHT FOR A COURTYARD MARRIOTT!!The manager's excuse was that we shouldn't have been able to book a room for this weekend due to it being a black out period and that our $400/night rate did not reflect the rate during the black out period. This was a ridiculous argument given the fact that we were already willing to pay almost three times the normal rate.After having Expedia provide proof of the reservation to the hotel manager, and after arguing with them for approx 30 minutes, they were still unwiling to honor the rate in our reservation confirmation from Expedia.Finally, given that we had already traveled to the festival, bought tickets to the festival, and every other hotel in a 20 mile radius was fully booked, we had not other choice but to take the room at this absurd rate.Subsequently four months later neither Marriott or Expedia are able to resolve the matter.I've been a loyal customer and have paid extremely inflated rates at this hotel during the festival over the past ten years. However after their greedy tactics of trapping me into paying an absolutely ridiculous rate this year, I will not stay here again. I highly advise each of you to proceed with caution. I hope you heed this warning of this location practicing unscrupulous business practices. Given that they have scammed us for approx $500, I hope enough of you will avoid this location so that they loose ten times this amount in future business. I hope the extra cash was with it to them.","Thank you for sharing your experience.We apologize for any inconvenience this situation may have caused you. Unfortunately, Expedia is a third party and they never made the reservation in our system, the rate provided was our rack rate for the night for a worldwide music event (Ultra Music fest). The company you used never provided proof of reservation as requested after speaking with them in several occasions. Therefore, we consider the hotel should not be blamed for it.Roberto FernandezFront Office ManagerCourtyard by Marriott Miami Downtown",Trip type: Traveled with friends,Date of stay: March 2016,"Response from Mariana S, Front Office Manager at Courtyard Miami Downtown Brickell Area","Responded Jul 25, 2016",87,82.17,99.0,5.67,46.99,21.75,27.59,81.61,48.28,13.79,11.49,0.0,4.6,4.6,0.0,2.3,2.3,8.05,13.79,6.9,3.45,2.3,3.45,13.79,2.3,2.3,0.0,1.15,2.3,5.75,3.45,2.3,0.0,1.15,0.0,19.54,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.79,1.15,4.6,1.15,2.3,3.45,1.15,4.6,0.0,3.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.34,6.9,0.0,3.45,0.0,0.0,5.75,5.75,1.15,10.34,0.0,3.45,6.9,3.45,4.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.49,5.75,3.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.3,0.0,37.6,1.108387096774194,1.460322580645161,1.589139784946236,322.565226200064,578.3176452356795,3.17,1.57,2.93,-0.03168235294117646,0.2781160295155448,0.2100590265485352,0.1956762974564339,0.1192160667432181,0.2942148194473874,-0.5380810810810811,0.3586666666666667,0.2410955554648358,0.2249320420594057,0.2690087541077752,0.4241212121212122,0.5141515151515152,0.6353333333333332,0.0,0.0,0.02150537634408602,0.03225806451612903,0.04301075268817205,9,15.0,True,Marriot

However, to keep costs down, they do not cool their elevator or hallways. It is stifling, and it effects your room being able to become cool as well.

I got bonus points upon check-in (400) but was never asked my preference. There was also water in the room that had a tag that they would charge you $3.50. I assumed (my fault) that Platinum members wouldn't be charged for the water, as is customary in other hotels - not so. I would skip it and stay at the Marriott by the Airport.

The bussiness center had the best connection (too bad we noticed the night before we left).Oh, room keys needed reprogramming 3 times in 6 days (and no, we didn‚Äôt keep the 4 keys close to credit cards).We wanted to ask for some stuff at the front desk, they told us literally, ‚Äúwe have no time for you right now, come back‚Äù.And last day, my sister had been told to ask for a birthday surprise present... they lost it! Kept us waiting until 12:30am (midnight), and the excuse! It wasn‚Äôt a package, it was a small cupcake box so it was easily lost!For $300 a night, not worth the bad feelings!","Thank you for this very valuable critique and review, please accept our sincerest apologies for the poor experience with our WIFI, I am delighted to let you know that we are doing a major upgrade to our complimentary and enhanced WIFI system, this will make the guest experience so much more productive, this project is on schedule to begin very shortly. This will be followed by the addition of 55"" TV's in all guest rooms, with an enhanced entertainment platform that will include easy access to Netflix and many other options. By the middle of summer will have the latest RFID room door lock system in place.

We were told at check-in that those connecting rooms did not exist in the hotel which of course was a lie. We had booked two connecting rooms for an entire week and ended up staying only the one night in two separate rooms, one of which, I might add, was not available until well past the promised check-in time of 4 pm.

I chose it because of the location to the few things we were doing in our limited time -- and because it's a Marriott (love earning points). The positives first: The food and service in the Bistro ---very good. We had both dinner and breakfast in the Bistro just because of convenience and we were not disappointed. The room was large, clean, and beds very comfy. There ya go. Those were the positives - and most importants of course. HOWever ... at nearly $200 for one night, I kind of expected juuuuust a little more. I get that they were under construction --which I was aware of ahead of time. But, the young lady that checked us in had trouble describing how to get to the parking garage..did not tell us to make sure we brought our parking ticket in to get stamped or validated ...and also was not very clear about the Bistro. She said we could get room service. However, in our room, there was no menu, just an info sheet about the Bistro but nothing with any pricing and/or any thing to write with etc. (Which is why we went down to the actual restaurant to eat afterall). Then, when checking out, that lady, not overly friendly I might add, could not explain what the extra $40 on our bill was. At first she said it was for our dinner last night. We paid cash. Then she said it was for our breakfast. We had vouchers for free breakfast ---annnnnd we had not been TO breakfast yet. Finally I asked her for a complete printout ---which she said was being emailed to me. I said, Please may I have a printout. Sheeesh. Finally she did and OH hey ..the $40 was for PARKING. I knew there was a parking fee, I did not know it would total up to $40!!! So we had a discussion about the parking. We went to eat -- (again, very nice and the servers in there were wonderful). Then I wanted to use the lobby floor restroom before we went to garage to leave. Ya had to have a code to get in. The same girl at the desk was still kind of snippy about it. :( Finally we head out. OH gee ... you either PAY as you are leaving or ya should have had the ticket validated (no it didn't say that ANYwhere). So I walked back up to the lobby ..the same girl says ... ""you could have pressed the intercom button""... I said, Hey, you could have said, OH BY THE WAY, may I validate your ticket for you now that you have paid $40 or be sure to press the intercom button and I will let you out"". I went back downstairs and sure enough, there was a tiny little button that said ""intercom"" (my friend hadn't seen that either. SO ... disappointing considering the number of Marriott's I've stayed in around the world. Just sayin' ...... but ...the beds were very comfy. That part was great!","Hello malpal,Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

153,-30,30.0,30.0,19.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,apologyTheGoodWevisitedS,Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Pioneer Square,30,"The Good: We visited Seattle for the Tulip Festival and finished up with some sight-seeing downtown. The Courtyard Marriott has an excellent location on the border of Pioneer Square. Centrally located for pretty much everything downtown. We walked to the Pier and had excellent meals at several restaurants very conveniently located. One of our tours picked us up directly from the hotel. The rooms, and beds in particular, were very comfortable. The Bad: This is a Marriott. It's a nice hotel, but it is not a luxury hotel. Our room was over $300 per night. Which was high for the quality, but fine because of the excellent location. Unfortunately, there is also no realistic overnight parking options. Because we had been touring the Tulip Festival, we had a rental car. If we stayed downtown Seattle again, I would probably drop off my family at the hotel. Return the rental to the airport and then take the light rail train back to the downtown area. Parking at the hotel was valet only and $40 per night and then of course, you also tip the valet. So, at a minimum, your stay is going up 15% a night. Quick word of warning - when using the valet, there is a bike path between it and the hotel. You really have to keep your eyes open or you will get hit by a bicyclist. Luckily nobody in our group got hit, but it is not the most safe valet location. The Ugly: Lobby and interior of the rooms were typical, nice Marriott. However, some of the rooms (our room was one of several) exterior windows face an old (abandoned?) building with broken windows, graffiti, etc. Horrible view so make sure you are picky when choosing the room. Also, it has a heated pool but it is not well-taken care of and really needs an update.","Thank you for your review, I am happy you enjoyed the location. We recently underwent a full renovation so the mattresses and box springs are all new. I am glad you found them comfortable. Our rates fluctuate seasonally with the demand in the market. Generally our rates are lower than most others in downtown Seattle. Being that we are an historic building, we do not have a parking garage in the hotel so we must lease garage space on the next block, hence the valet only option. Parking is at a premium in all of downtown Seattle, so I always encourage guests to use public transportation if they can do without a car while visiting. I sincerely apologize for the view from your room. The rooms on that side of the building face another brick building and therefore obscure any city view from that side on the lower floors.I appreciate your comments and I hope you will stay with us again in the future.Regards,David",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: April 2019,"Response from David K, Manager at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Pioneer Square","Responded May 9, 2019",167,72.51,91.57,83.93,92.57,18.56,20.36,88.62,54.49,16.17,13.17,3.59,4.19,4.19,0.0,1.2,2.99,10.18,11.98,7.78,4.79,4.79,1.2,10.78,6.59,2.99,0.0,0.0,2.99,6.59,5.39,1.2,0.0,0.0,1.2,13.17,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.0,11.98,1.2,1.8,1.8,4.19,2.4,2.99,1.2,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.6,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.19,4.79,0.0,2.4,0.0,0.0,0.6,8.38,1.8,20.96,2.4,13.77,5.39,1.2,1.8,4.19,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.98,5.99,2.99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,64.9,1.10623595505618,1.717191011235955,1.734606741573034,340.7305177454876,585.2143213955248,6.066000000000001,2.98,7.48,0.02368452380952383,0.2182072071070243,0.2865458763201427,0.1892218747607748,0.200230508635738,0.3511078643891016,-0.3600821917808217,0.318578947368421,0.2480124955754788,0.1750388742718012,0.2877552209495219,0.4052931034482759,0.5260862068965517,0.6573620689655172,0.02808988764044944,0.0,0.01123595505617977,0.03932584269662921,0.03932584269662921,5,13.8,True,Marriot

We were totally unaware of the parking situation and prices. The website leads you to believe that close by self park is free where as valet parking is $42 per night. Close by is close but charges plenty with no in and out privileges and a 10 hour max on the weekends. Street parking is available at night only and must be off the street by 8:00am. Housekeeping at this hotel is spotty. The positive is that it's close to the ball parks and within walking distance of the waterfront. There are a few decent places to eat near bay. Also, front desk staff are very nice, helpful and friendly. I would stay here again, but would hope that things improve as far as parking and housekeeping.","Thank you for your review of the Pioneer Square Courtyard. I would like to apologize if our website was confusing in regards to parking. As you mentioned, the only parking that is affiliated with the hotel is the valet parking. Other options are other parking garages in the immediate area and metered street parking (which is free from 6pm-8am). However, I am happy to hear about the Front Desk staff and that you would stay here again. I will pass on your comments to our Housekeeping Manager and hope you do stay with us again soon.Laura SchlesFront Office Manager",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: October 2015,"Response from Laura S, Front Office Manager at Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Pioneer Square","Responded Oct 15, 2015",101,53.28,93.12,24.35,90.82,16.83,23.76,85.15,56.44,16.83,11.88,2.97,2.97,5.94,0.0,0.0,4.95,5.94,13.86,9.9,6.93,5.94,0.0,15.84,3.96,0.99,0.99,0.0,0.0,5.94,4.95,0.99,0.99,0.0,0.0,12.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.91,0.0,0.0,3.96,3.96,0.0,3.96,1.98,0.99,0.99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.92,3.96,0.0,3.96,0.0,0.0,0.99,11.88,2.97,13.86,2.97,8.91,3.96,5.94,1.98,0.99,0.99,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.89,5.94,1.98,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.99,0.0,0.0,1.98,0.0,39.5,1.348888888888888,2.105648148148148,1.994814814814815,336.8800029262447,589.7171602226808,5.800000000000001,2.505,5.385,-0.02370588235294118,0.2279101735383223,0.2233678793455627,0.1437049476782229,0.2392176993291623,0.3462018838795961,-0.3024464285714285,0.3156304347826088,0.0915128756103849,0.1577262409742965,0.3028925879577703,0.4108780487804879,0.5141707317073172,0.65009756097561,0.02777777777777778,0.0,0.0,0.02777777777777778,0.05555555555555555,6,20.0,True,Marriot

The front desk was very persistent with needing a credit card for incidentals (per our company, we are not required to give our personal card for incidentals). The front desk associate said she ""wouldn't not give me a room, until she had a card on file"", even though the rooms were already paid for. So I waited for 30+ minutes to get the problem squared away. At no point did the manager on duty come out to try and rectify the problem, so I was left at the front desk wasting valuable time.This property seems outdated. My room was clean, but very small. There was no refrigerator or microwave. I did enjoy the shared pool, which I believe is actually on Marriott property. The airport shuttle runs frequently and promptly. This is an average hotel, do not expect anything spectacular here... There's no attention to detail. Fine for a one night stay before your next flight out.I hope the GM takes a better look at the quality of service offered at the front desk, and the overall appearance of the hotel.","Thank you for choosing to stay with us and thank you for your feedback.

The service at the restaurant was slow even though there were barely any people eating, but the food was decent. The real problem with the hotel is the airport shuttle to the hotel. The bus kept passing us by even though there were open seats. I went as far as to call the hotel and ask them to tell the driver where we were waiting but he still kept passing us. The bus arrived every 15-20 minutes, but it took us an hour to get the bust to stop for us. I finally decided to jump in front of the bus to stop it, and that was what it took.

172,16,15.0,16.0,25.0,,,,,,,,,,apologyIamgenerallyafano,Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,20,"I am generally a fan of boutique hotels and didn't come in the door here expecting the trappings of big and fancy, but I was very disappointed with my stay here. My first impression was the valet, who wasn't at his station, but around the corner smoking a cigarette or something. When he did come over, rather than welcoming me, he first admonished me that I needed to back the car up a foot because I was encroaching the red zone. I grabbed my bag and walked into the lobby - tiny but cute, with a well-stocked bar and music playing. There was a loud group sitting in the lobby drinking and chatting, and the acoustics made the decibel level even greater, plus I think they were trying to talk over the music. Ugh. The bright ray of sunshine was the young man at the desk - Justice, I think he said his name was (or at least over the noise, I that's what I thought I heard). He was delightful, someone who really knows what the service/hospitality business is about. In addition to checking me into my room, he helped find a charger for my phone and offered empathy for my tedious travel day. Every hotel could use someone like him.No elevator here, so if you have a second floor room, I'd suggest going light on the bag. Walking down the hallway, it was clear to me that his place was some kind of apartment conversion. The rooms are appointed nicely...the bed was fantastic, TV modern, nice amenities, and the AC works great, which was important since it was almost 100 here today. Downsides to the room - you can hear EVERYTHING in the rooms on either side. When the guy in the next room got into the shower at 3:30 am, you would have thought he was in the shower in my room the water in the pipes was so loud. The wireles works, but I had to sit on the floor near the door to get it to stay connected consistently. And something I thought I'd never say, but the hot water is too hot! There isn't any safety feature to keep it from getting to scalding...it was difficult to get it warm and then all of a sudden it was dangerous. I bought a bloodspot coupon, so this room only cost me $115, which is incredible for any establishment in Beverly Hills and I appreciate the proximity to all of the shopping, etc. But if I had paid the full price (I think $235) for this room, I'd be fuming.",Thank you for the response. We are sorry to hear about the valet staff that was at the property that day and we will do our best to remedy the situation you spoke of. We're happy to hear you loved our amenities and we hope you come visit us again soon.,Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: September 2011,"Response from crescentbeverlyhills, Manager at Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills","Responded Sep 26, 2011",51,48.23,99.0,3.12,99.0,17.0,7.84,90.2,62.75,25.49,21.57,0.0,13.73,7.84,0.0,0.0,3.92,7.84,13.73,7.84,5.88,3.92,0.0,23.53,5.88,1.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.76,9.8,1.96,0.0,0.0,1.96,31.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.92,0.0,1.96,1.96,1.96,0.0,0.0,5.88,0.0,5.88,0.0,1.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,19.61,15.69,1.96,3.92,1.96,0.0,3.92,15.69,5.88,11.76,3.92,1.96,5.88,1.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.84,5.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.96,0.0,0.0,18.5,1.364727272727273,2.044,2.055454545454545,308.9191307002353,603.6739827889803,6.260000000000001,2.84,7.140000000000001,0.01203773584905659,0.09018053982522165,0.162098163160536,0.1659111624451942,0.2128823317991681,0.5025070149514058,-0.2794642857142857,0.33852,0.1541264649306298,0.218862667321572,0.2258895757079679,0.3956842105263158,0.5394210526315789,0.7184736842105263,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1272727272727273,0.07272727272727272,4,18.0,True,Unaffiliated

We asked what time the roof top opens up and they said it was $125 per person charge. We were never informed of the charge when we called earlier. To make matters worst, they were sold out.

Even when traveling, hotels and airlines are putting in special measures to ensure a safe and healthy travel experience. I have been limiting my travels due to the pandemic, but recently I had to travel to Houston. I have been to Houston many times and stayed at various hotels throughout the city, mostly in the Galleria area. When I was looking this time, I found a good deal at the Doubletree in the Galleria area. I have stayed here twice (see reviews here) and the experience was mixed - the rooms were nice but the service bad - but I decided to give it another try.The hotel has gone through some renovations on the inside (and this was evident in my previous stay in 2017) and since then the only additions have been due to COVID, which included partitions around the check-in desk, markers on the floor for social distancing, wipes next to the elevator, and signs stating masks were required. Other than that, everything was the same including how small the hotel entrance is; the layout of the hotel is such that you have the hotel building, the parking garage, and a small connector between the two. As you enter the connector, the parking garage is to your right, the connector in the middle, and the hotel on the left; the entrance is small generally and gets more crowded once there is a rush. Both valet and self-parking are available.The lobby itself is wide and spacious. The waiting area is right in front, while the check-in desks are to the left and the elevators and meeting rooms are to the right. As both the meeting rooms and elevators are in the same direction, it can become a bit crowded when there events taking place. I have stayed at other hotels during the pandemic (see review here) and their restrictions were far more strict than what was done here. There was no restriction on limiting the hotel to only guests so anyone could enter and exit as they please. Also, even though the state had mandated a mask-wearing policy and the hotel had signs requesting masks be worn, there was no enforcement or verbal reminders regarding mask wearing. In terms of social distancing, the only stickers on the floor were the ones in front of the check-in counters and they were not adhered to by most guests (nor enforced by the hotel staff). Check-in was okay but there was no customer service aspect - no greeting, no welcoming a Hilton Honors member, and not checking the reservation before asking questions, in fact it was the bare minimum of service expected and required; even the cookies, which are normally handed out at the beginning had to be requested. I received the key and proceeded to my room.The waiting area for the elevators can become crowded very quickly as there are 4 elevators all converging onto the same waiting area. They did have wipes for guests to use to wipe down the surface, but this was at your personal preference. Also, other hotels had enforced either a minimum number of guests in the elevators or only same-household groups in the elevators; none of that was mentioned nor enforced here and it was basically to each their own how they wanted to proceed. Previously, given my status, I have been upgraded to a junior suite and those rooms, while outdated, are quite spacious; this time I was not upgraded so I was given a standard Doubletree room.As you enter the room, on the left was the bathroom which contained a toilet, a shower/tub, a sink with lots of counter space. The bathroom was standard with standard amenities and toiletries needed to be requested from the front desk. Further inside the room, on the left were two double beds with a nightstand in the middle. The beds were generally comfortable, decent in size and overall good in sleep comfort. Across from the beds, against the wall, was a console that had a TV on top, an open shelf with the coffee/tea as well as ice bucket, drawers on the bottom, a fridge on the bottom, and a small table next to it. There was a large window across one wall and in between the window and the bed was a chaise lounge chair. There was a lot of furniture in the room and given the amount of things in the room, the standard size of the room, and then add people to that, the room felt small and cramped and some of the furniture needed to be removed to make the room feel more open.The hotel is full-service so there are many amenities for the guests to enjoy including a pool, a gym, meeting rooms, business center, restaurant, parking garage, and wifi. As I said earlier, parking was a nightmare both times I stayed here; you have to pay for parking so considering it requires payment, you think they would come up with a better solution. The gym also needs to be remodeled as its small and is located on the 3rd floor, right next to other rooms (it looks like they converted two rooms into a gym). The business center was 3 computers in the open lobby on the other side of the check-in desks. There was complimentary printing, but there was also a lot of noise; the wifi was complimentary and provided decent speeds.Overall, its an average hotel in the Galleria area. Plus points are the location, the hotel's signature cookies, and the spacious rooms and full-size fridge in the suites. Negatives include inconsistent and poor customer service and horrible (paid) parking situation, and particularly to covid no enforcement or adherence to public health-related guidelines. Given the horrible parking situation, the lack of adherence to public health guidelines and overall the general lack of service provided this was my last time staying at this hotel.","Dear 0504Traveller,It is always a treat to welcome back our repeat guests and we thank you for settling in again.

Even with a confirmation and the hotels page letting me know my room has been booked and guaranteed, the worker made NO attempt to help me resolve the issue outside telling me to call the third parties 1-800 line. After sitting with her for about 5 mins and showing her the email from the third party with ALL my information for the stay, she still made no attempt to help me make sense of how apparently the third party has a DIFFERENT confirmation number that I never received and that was the reason I needed to get in contact with them. As I tried to get better explanation from a different worker 3 minutes later (because the one I was working with was busy with another costumer now) She stopped what she was doing, walks over to the other counter and interrupts the other worker trying to explain to me how to fix this but now even more with a condescending tone. Now none of this would have been an issue if one, they had had my room ready for at least when I DID finally check in (told me it would be a two hour wait from original check in time) but also had the audacity to have a side bar conversation full of snarky comments to her coworker has I was standing 4 feet across the counter thinking I couldn't hear her. When I finally called her out on her disrespectful actions and poor consumer service, I was told I they didn't have to service me or help me. After speaking extremely loud in front of the entire lobby telling me to ""have a blessed day"" in the most condescending tone, I was forced to try to find a different hotel to stay at in Houston.. that in which I wasn't able to get a room or a hotel til about 5:45 that evening. I missed the appointment I originally traveled to Houston for in the first place and lost a client due to the lack of help from the double tree hotel to fix a mistake that I had no part in.Overall I have never been more appalled by the lack of effort to resolve the issue at hand by Staff.Never again.","Dear CoachDaviddd,Thank you for sharing your feedback and we apologize again for the troubles had in locating a confirmed reservation.

My husband and I were attending a conference in Long Beach and weren't able to find a hotel there that would allow our dogs to stay. This hotel was nice enough although I would not say it was excellent. We stayed in room 288. I'll start with the Pros...Front desk staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Our AC was making funny noises and we called the front desk to help with that and they sent someone right away. The maintenance worker was very kind and was able to sort the issue out for us. Each employee I had interaction with was very friendly! Great customer service all around. The price was reasonable for the area although I would not pay it again. Location was great, it wasn't far from where our conference was being held and right on the marina which was lovely. Parking was easy, we have a large truck and had no trouble at all. The gym was nice.The cons...The smell in the hallways and stairways was almost unbearable. The bathroom in our room had a horrible smell as well, luckily I had some bathroom spray to neutralize it. The bathtub drain was broken and did not hold water so baths were not an option. The sliding bathroom door needs to go! I suggest getting a real door. Bathroom needs more towel hooks for hanging towels. The AC was loud even after maintenance tried to fix the issue. But I have to say the most disappointing was the over priced room service. The food was AWFUL! Wifi isn't free.Overall we enjoyed our stay.",Thank you so much for providing this valuable feedback.

I did not have any issues with check in, but unfortunately the last impression of the hotel was very uncomfortable and one that the guests leave with.Main issue is one of the bellhoppers. I forgot his name, but he was a semi older gentleman with a white, shortish haircut. When I asked the front desk if I could temporary store a luggage for 2 hours, he was the person they called. The very FIRST words he said to me was ""I work for tip."" I replied okay, as it is not unusual to tip later on, and shortly after he gives me the ticket connecting to the luggage #. Immediately after giving the card, he repeats again ""I work for tip."" I asked him if I can tip after, as that was what I was used to. He just stands there repeating ""I work for tip."" Then he stands there staring at me. It was very uncomfortable. I have never met a bellhopper or other service staff that aggressive and demands to be paid tip upfront and will NOT move or help you out until so. It was extremely rude. It is up to you to decide, whether to tip or just hope for the best that your luggage was safe. Even if you asked for another bellhopper, it is uncomfortable, as this guy knows exactly where your luggage will be stored and what it looks like. I was pretty much forced to tip on the spot, otherwise you do not know what he will do with your luggage. My trust for the hotel went from 100% immediately to 10%, because of this guy. On top of that, it was near impossible to find him again, as expected. Obviously he got a great deal. $ for putting your luggage somewhere, and then running off. As expected, he would not be around to help you retrieve your luggage. It screws over not just the customer, but also the other bell hoppers who undoubtedly will be faced with an uncomfortable situation when they retrieve your bags. The other bell hoppers will not know that you already tipped the first time. Juan, on the other hand, was another bell hopper who I met and is an amazing gentleman by his actions toward other guests that I saw. He was very pleasant to work with, who was tipped generously afterwards.If anyone does choose this hotel, I would avoid the first bellhopper in particular. Unfortunately I do not know his name at the time, but just be on the lookout and extra cautious around him.","Dear Guest, I am extremely sorry to hear you did not have a good experience with one of our staff members. Please rest assure that the incident was addressed with the staff member and we will continue coaching our staff to avoid others guests from having the same experience.

However, we barely slept a wink at this hotel. Our first room was by a noisy group of people and the walls are paper-thin so you can hear everything. We moved rooms, and got a somewhat better night of sleep although the AC unit made some strange noises. The worst part is that you are only a block and a half away from a medical center so ambulances are constantly passing by with sirens at all hours of the night. We also got more noisy guests nearby the second night, who were clearly smoking in their room, so that smell along with their chatter, the doors slamming all night and the elevator kept us up. The entire hotel is very small and cramped (rooms included) so you hear everything on your floor. Breakfast was fine, just a little stale and they started to pack it up before 10AM (also no one told us where or when breakfast was). Valet parking is expensive but street parking is next to impossible to find close by. Very convenient to the Armory Track; otherwise not much to offer and probably would not stay there again.","Dear sab048,Glad that the team was accommodating and friendly with you. I'm sorry to hear about the disturbances overnight. I apologize for the AC noise, they usually run very quiet - I hope the crew was able to help you with that issue. Looks like the neighbors you had were nuisances for you, and I apologize for them. We can only control the environment no the people who stay in it. I am so sorry for the smoking neighbors! We have a strict non-smoking policy in our property. For those who smoke and we find out, they are always asked to take it outside or leave. The complimentary breakfast is daily from 7am-9am, my apologies if no one informed you. Unfortunately parking is at a premium in New York City, but sometimes with patience a street parking opens from time to time. I'm glad it was convenient for your visit to the Armory.

The rooms themselves are nice --the one we had was a spotless bathroom, the tv had great cable, the space was fine. The front desk staff and door staff were always friendly and there for anything. The breakfast is simple but good, fresh waffles, good coffee, and so on. Plus there is a nice happy hour with wine and snacks. The location is a bit odd for walking anywhere, at least it is close to Beverly Center (but that is under renovation.) But there are so many of the hotel rooms situated around a small cubbyhole of a inner court only, meaning little light and the noise is impossible to keep out. The other option is to a loud large boulevard street. The walls have absolutely no acoustic isolating qualities, heard the different couples sex, tv watching, etc. And for the price, I was surprised it has no fitness center at all.","Dear Passenger121,Thank you for your recent stay and for taking the time to share your recent experience with our fellow trip advisors.

I am Platinum...Is there a Diamond/Saphire/Cryptonium level at this hotel that Platinum members arriving at a normal check in time receive the worst room?I like the idea of a very small but efficient room, but whoever designed Element clearly wanted the room to be ugly and uncomfortable. The headboard is right next to the horrible connecting door which becomes the center piece in the tiny room. After a few tries, the receptionist was able to find me a slightly better room although still ADA....Shower was disgusting being same level as the bathroom floor, bathroom was semi-flooded. It is the movable ugly shower with a hose and water pressure is horrible.The hotel is a relatively new building and you would expect it to be well insolated, yet climate control was not pleasant. you could turn it up to 80 degrees, its hot as hell yet the cold air is coming in like there is a hole in the wall somewhere. The temperature in the room never really got comfortable.The common/breakfast area looks like a bad school cafeteria, really unpleasant.Also, if you are not familiar with the area, the Seaport is a very ugly industrial-looking outskirt of downtown.This Element is same SPG category 5 as both Westin and Sheraton in Boston. Are you kidding me?!","Dear DIOGENES L...thank you for sharing your comments following your most recent stay at the Element Boston Seaport. Typically, the Element brand ranks very high among our SPG traveler base -- our property being among the top performers for all Element Hotels.

I am very dissatisfied with a couple of things.1. Parking $20 a day: Everyday my 2 kids and I had to park at the end because your employees take up the front ones, making unloading and loading very difficult. That is ridiculous.2. There was construction all around the hotel making it very difficult to get to the hotel in the first place. The roads that did eventually lead to the hotel were all flooded.3. My room smelled like old water. A very strong smell as soon as you walked in.4. The sofabed was very difficult to close, it would get very stuck. My husband almost got his arm stuck trying to close it.5. There was a $50 refundable deposit that was not stated at ALL during booking or check in. ""I know most hotels charge a deposit but they disclose that at check in"".When I addressed parking with the assistant GM Yamil, I was simply told that it is a hotel policy that everyone most follow. He didn't even address the fact that his employees are taking up the small amount parking that are for guests. I also called the corporate office and I was told it needed to be handled at a local level, so since no one wants to help that is why I am writing this review.","Thank you for sharing your feedback, K3849VWstephanier.I am truly disheartened that you did not enjoy your stay here with us.

The hotel staff did not want us to dig through the trash, and kept saying they would never throw stuff away that wasn't in the garbage can.

The next morning the maid knocked on my hotel door. She had gotten in trouble and asked if I had found my orders. I said ""yes"". She wanted me to tell the staff that I had found them. I said that they already knew I found them because they sat and watched my husband and I dig through the trash.

221,26,-14.0,30.0,25.0,20.0,,,,,,,,,apologyLetmebeginbysaying,Embassy Suites By Hilton Houston West - Katy,10,"Let me begin by saying that our family exclusively stays at Hilton properties. Our stay at this Embassy Suites on the 14th and 15th of July had its fair share of ups and downs.Pros:This hotel is conveniently located right off of the expressway with plenty of food and entertainment options within a very short drive. We were in town to watch an Astros game and got to the stadium in about 25 minutes.The breakfast is definitely a plus with this property. Plenty of options were available and the wait staff was working at a feverish pace to ensure that all the tables were cleaned promptly to accommodate the large crowd on hand.The managers reception was great. I dont drink but my wife enjoyed the wide variety of options and snacks that were available.The property seems very new so it has the ‚Äúwow‚Äù factor that a lot of the older Embassy Suites are missing.Cons:Check in took a while as there was only one individual at the front desk working.I asked if there were any available upgrades for me to purchase and I got the ‚ÄúJulia Roberts‚Äù look when she asked to try on a dress on Rodeo Drive. The only reason I had asked was because the check in feature on the Hilton app told me there were plenty of upgrades available that morning but I failed to confirm it. Wasn‚Äôt a huge deal but I was more upset with the response than the availability.Upon arrival two dirty towels and a wine glass were left next to our door. I thought that was fairly disgusting and the gentleman that setup our pack n play walked right passed it twice and didn‚Äôt bat an eyelash.OUR ROOM DID NOT GET CLEANED! We left for the Astros game at exactly 11:45am and returned to the hotel at 9:00pm to find the room hadn‚Äôt been touched. We are by no means messy people but when you have an infant cleanliness is a priority. I called the front desk to inquire and the gentleman that answered the phone apologized and offered us dessert. I thought I was hearing things and he repeated dessert. I told him none of us were hungry but a clean room was a priority to us. I hung up and got in touch with Hilton corporate via the Hilton app. Submitted a request and got a response within seconds. They informed me that I would be moved to another room. I went downstairs and the poor front desk gentleman was completely overwhelmed. The phone was ringing off the hook and there was a line of other guests waiting. At this point my 15 month old reached her peak tiredness and as many parents know breaking a toddler‚Äôs routine is dangerous. We got our new room and proceeded to move our endless amount of bags across the hall and the hotel issued pack n play refused to cooperate so I literally had to carry it opened down the hall which was no easy feat. At this point I realized that this issue ended up becoming my problem for some reason. My wife and I talked about the issue and we both felt like we were being punished for a service that we paid very good money for. I got back on the Hilton app and asked what else could be done for our situation and I received a response informing me that the Head of Housekeeping would be contacting me. At this point I have heard nothing from cooperate or the hotel.I feel that this property really missed the boat on our stay. We stayed at a Hampton Inn and Suites in Dallas and the fire alarm went off during the day and as compensation they comped our room for one night. I wasn‚Äôt asking for the moon, but a little appreciation would have gone a long way.","lgarza1010, first of all i would like to thank you for choosing our hotel for your recent stay and taking time in letting us know how we did.

I will say, it is conveniently located right behind the rental car building at Logan.the Lobby areas, restarant and bar are well lit and very open. the pool is smallish, but adequate. The gym...is a small hotel gym...I've been in better and worse. the equipment is newer, but this isn't a Gold's Gym or a YMCA quality selection.They only offer Valet parking...which was not mentioned by my TA, nor did I find it readily noted on any of the standard travel websites. IT IS $51 PER DAY and you have no other choice. It is cheaper to par your car over at the airport and walk over to the lot daily. I guess if you can Uber/Lyft it, or take the rail...or just staying here for the night, then...not an issue...but dang...1/5th of my nightly cost is for the car...I kind of feel like it should get to come up to the room with me for that price...reverse the numbers and it is a bit more reasonable.I ate at the restaurant and the food was ""meh"", not spectacularly ""New England"", but the seafood was fresh and the taste was appealing.At the end f the day, if you need to stay by Logan for an early morning flight and are dropping off your rental car, or you are arriving late and want to crash for a night before renting a car and leaving...it is not a bad place and you get the value you pay for.","Dear hurricaneJoe,Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay the Embassy Suites Boston Logan Airport.

But this property combines incompetence with indifference. We did an advance booking meaning we prepaid. Some of our family arrived first and were told we had to pay for the rooms. When the manager was told it was prepaid, she refused to check and just demanded a credit card. No amount of pleading would convince her to move her precious fingers to the keyboard to just check. Once we came back with proof, no apology and couldn't be bothered to do a refund. Nope, we had to wait until next week when someone ""who the number to call"" would be back. Seriously. She said EVERY manager but her knew the number. The ironic thing was the next day (Saturday) the morning manager had the same, exact story! Calling the Hilton Honors desk was no help as they apparently have no way to actually force a manager to get up and actually do something. Mistakes happen.

Unfortunately, the A/C unit was not working properly so the heat and humidity were unpleasant to the point where there was no rest at night. Maintenance did come to fix the A/C unit but a puddle of water had gathered on the carpet that they were planing to address a little later but that didn't happen. However, the attached restaurant - Hearsay - was good. Not a large menu but the food is abundant. Room service was very quick but costly - expect 21% surcharge plus a $5 delivery fee before tip. It's much less expensive to eat in the restaurant which always had people in there but was never so full I couldn't get a seat. The free breakfast was good. Scrambled eggs, sausage, bacon, and another breakfast staple along with made-to-order omelets, etc. The evening reception wasn't bad, either. Essentially what you'd expect from Embassy. I couldn't find the bar area, but wasn't really looking very hard since I had only planned to have a soda with my snacks. Oddly enough, I didn't see anyone checking to ensure the participants were really hotel guests as I've experienced with most other Embassy Suites. Overall, good atmosphere, good food, great staff but just needs to get some of the kinks out for a good night's stay.",Thank you so much for your feedback and recommendation.

Notwithstanding my room was on the 15th floor, I was kept awake by the noise. Had I known, I would have asked to prepare the sofa bed in the living room, which being internal was somehow sheltered. For the rest, the stay was ok, even if the a/c unit was not well balanced between bedroom and living room, and even if their free shuttle service does not extend to The Galleria shopping mall like other hotels downtown (over the phone, I had been advised otherwise). I would have appreciated being advised of the Final Four and the associated noise to be expected. So, all I remember of the stay at this hotel is the last two sleepless nights. I think I am generous in giving a rating of 3, and I doubt I will go back.","Thank you for taking the time to complete this review and tell us about your stay.

I was here for work meetings and would not recommend this hotel for any kind of business meeting. The AV package that we purchased didn't work - the conference phone wasn't working, AV hook ups were not standard and we needed to rush out to office depot. No staff on hand to help us.Sleeping rooms were moderately clean but not sure if hotel is old or if it is due to the AC system, but all the rooms smelled moldy - the ac is blasting so you get that ""cold"" smell, but the minute you adjust it, you get the moldy smell. The business center is a joke - the printer jammed and then ran out of paper and they wanted me to fix it. One of our members needed to go to urgent care and the nice front staff person couldn't let us know where to go and directed us to a CVS that does not have a minute clinic! FYI, a few blocks past that CVS is an excellent Urgent Care. If you like shopping malls (I don't) this hotel is walking distance to the Galleria, so maybe you'd like that. A colleague found a dildo outside his door on a Wed. night. I wouldn't recommend this hotel.","Dear tikidream,Thank you for your review.

Talking to several employees this has been the number one complaint from customers. Even when the doors are shut there is a two inch opening on both sides. There is no privacy when using the bathroom anytime someone uses the bathroom every noise can be heard from the bedroom and living room area. I should mention there's no lock on the bathroom doors as well!! Furthermore, the closet combining the living room to the bedroom is open when the doors are opened up so you can see in from the bedroom to living room.Be warned if you want any privacy using the bathroom or residing in the bedroom for that matter the Embassy Suites in Seattle will not offer that luxury.","Hello from the Embassy Suites Seattle,Thank you for taking the time to share this review with us.

Once again we found the staff helpful and efficient. The rooms were, once again, clean and free of odors. The hotel is right across the street from the library, for those so oriented and just down from the convention center, which had the hotel booked the next night forcing us to move on. We‚Äôd booked through Expedia for just over $100, as last time. For that amount these small rooms, typical for an older hotel, are a good value, especially given the location. Convention rates were closer to $600 a night, way way over what is reasonable.

Two friends traveling together so at least there were two luggage racks, but little space to hang clothes. Good for a short, two night stay. All of the pillows on the bed were super firm, Second morning, someone knocked and tried to enter around when we were still in bed. Bathroom miniscule, and no rack to hang wet towels on the wall, though there was space to add one.. The bathtub didn't drain properly so while showering, I stood in a pool of water. Friendly guy at front desk. He recommended the Crab Pot, and we were very disappointed. (Zero ambiance (a roll of paper towels for napkins). Complimentary wine reception a nice touch. The area is hilly, so be prepared for that. Walking distance to Pike's Market, and a steep 3 block uphill walk upon your return. (Recommend seeing the public library across the street; magnificent architecture.) They do include a clock with charger outlets, a coffee pot for those drinking black coffee, iron, bottles of water.

They should allow guests plenty of time to answer before coming in. I am sorry if that was not the case! I will remind them. Also, FYI, the team will NEVER know on a door if the DND sign is out.Room should always be in good working order and I am sorry that your tub was not draining properly.

The lobby assured us the room would be quiet--but in reality, it faced street with garbage dumpsters that had a 4:30AM pickup time. If you're sensitive to noise, advise you make sure your room is NOT facing the dumpsters. While the room was clean, amenities were pretty basic and the facilities a bit dated. For the rate ($180/night), this seemed overpriced. We've stayed in nicer hotels in the same area that had more modern furnishings for less. Would not likely stay again.","Michael C,I appreciate you taking the time to write a review about your recent stay and provide us with feedback. It is regrettable that you were woken early by the garbage trucks and that this left a poor impression on you.

267,8,30.0,30.0,-21.0,30.0,-9.0,,,,,,,,apologyThisreviewisbaseds,Fairfield Inn & Suites Miami Airport South,10,"This review is based solely on the first desk clerk Elsa. Who was not only rude but treated the guests like feces under her shoe.Upon arriving at the hotel, Elsa asked for the name on our reservation and for our ID and card. She turned and started to yell at this elderly gentleman that she was not accepting any cash at the moment. He walked around to the front of the desk. I assume because he couldn't hear her to which she replied. Sir, didn't I just say we are not accepting any cash. I felt bad for how she spoke to him but said nothing. As we provided her with our information, she indicated we would be charged a half for the room for one night and incidental. We explained we shouldn't have any charges other than incidentals because our reward points covered the room. She said she didn't see that in her system so she couldn't honor it. We then provided her with a copy of the confirmation email that was sent when we called Marriott to make the reservations she still said I can't do anything with that because it's not in my system. In a condescending voice, she tells us you can call Marriott and complain but not until Monday because they are closed. We took the key and went to our room. As we walked in two people were sleep in the bed. We must have scared one coming in and woke him up. We closed the door and went back down to the front desk. My mother spoke to Elsa and I called Marriott. I was able to talk with someone. He called Else to speak with her about the situation. We can overhear her speaking to the guy in the same tone that was used with us. She told him she hadn't been to the room to verify if someone was in bed, but her system said the sroom was empty (like we lied) and that her system also didn't show that our points covered the room. After she hung up, he came back on the line with me and said she will be issuing you a refund for the amount charged and changing your room. I also understand your complaint about the attitude it sounds like she may need some training. I will notate the account and request that additional compensation is provided to you all. We left asked Else to verify the conversation then went up to the new room after she gave us a new key.Thinking the problem was solved, we went to bed only to wake up to an additional charge for another night and another $10 random charge. We only stayed that one night and would be leaving for a cruise the next morning. We went down to the front desk and explained what happened. Elsa was gone by this point. Both women working the desk indicated they did not have the authority to do anything. We asked them to call the manager. She tried to say it was just a misunderstanding and brush Elsa's actions under the rug. She did pay for our cab to the port; however, the money was held on our card and not released until the end of the cruise. We spoke with the GM, who again apologized on behalf of his staff, indicated he was not aware of anything that took place, but he would like the opportunity to correct the issue if we would give them another chance. At first, we were not going to take him up on the offer but decided we would allow them to fix the problem when we returned. We needed a room for one night. Well, when we called to make arrangements, we were told the only thing they would do as a resolution was allow us to book the room at a senior discount rate. Unacceptable since we already qualify for this. If you have the chance to stay at this hotel DON'T. Find one that will give you a room without a stranger in the bed and someplace that would value you as a customer.","Dear Guest,Thank you for choosing to stay at the Fairfield Inn & Suites Miami Airport South and providing your honest feedback on the Guest Satisfaction Survey.Providing the highest level of hospitality is our number one priority and we sincerely apologize for falling short of meeting your expectations.

We proceeded to check in where the front desk lady tells me there will be a $150 hold on my card. When I said no way! She speaks to the manager and it goes to $25. They failed to mention we were being billed for parking as well.Off we go to our room only to find out the King ""suite"" did not have a pull out sofa as we thought. We request to switch rooms since we needed the extra bed for my oldest daughter so ended up in a double. When we return from a nice day touring Miami we settle in our new space and my nine month old who is in the crawling stage stands near the air vent 2 feet from me and suddenly starts choking! It was bad enough that we panicked and called 911 and called the front desk to do the same. Long story short, whatever choked the baby was not in her throat but she had coughed up some blood which is why we panicked. Manager came upstairs to emphasize he called 911. once he saw the baby was ok and commotion settled he left without a word. We went back in the room and I searched the floor thoroughly until I found the culprit. what appeared to be clear plastic tags. Not ours since we had nothing new and nothing near the area she choked. I went the next morning to the front desk and told the housekeeping needs to be more thorough and also told the manager I wanted a copy of the incident. He says ""what incident?"" I said my baby was choking bad, lips turned blue and you say nothing happened?? I was furious at that point on how he dismissed it as if since she didnt die then I guess no incident report needs to be written. he also followed it by saying I could not prove that those tags were already in the room as if defending himself from a lawsuit! Basically I wanted it for any doctor follow and to ensure that his upper management was aware. I plan to follow up with Fairfields corporate headquarters on this because I cannot believe how this ""manager"" dismissed a very traumatic incident in the room as nothing.Yes I can go on about the filthy outdated place and the crappy breakfast but this was so much more. He could have done many things as a manager to follow up and ensure everything was ok but he truly did not care. I cannot support a company that does not show even a bit of sympathy in such a situation for its patrons. Hope someone from upper management see this.","Dear Ms Lilliam,I can only imagine how upset you felt that we fell short on providing empathy to you when you most needed it.

The hotel is new and the location is superb, however there are several points that made our stay unpleasant:1. We've booked ahead a King room. Upon arrival (at 11 pm) we were notified that there is no clean King room available. Fortunately they upgraded us to an executive double room. The room was large and everything was new.2. The floor in the room was completely covered in dirt dust and nails. It seemed as if they never cleaned the floor since construction ended. We've asked 3 times at the reception for the floor to be cleaned but they never did.2. On our 3rd day we received an e-mail notifying us that we are being checked out. Our reservation was for 4 nights. consequently we were moved to a different room.3. The second room we were moved to was nice and very cozy, however it was right next to their ice machine which made a terrible noise with people filling ice throughout the night. when you book make sure to ask for a room not near the ice machine.4. The air conditioner at that room has only 2 modes- it would either heat indefinitely (no temperature control) or when we tried to shut it down the room turned freezing. As you can imagine we slept very poorly on our last night.5. various small irritations included: there is no drawers (for clothes or whatnot) anywhere in the room except one small drawer by the bed. there is exactly zero hangers for towels which you are supposed to just throw on the floor I assume. the hallways are narrow and painted black for some reason and give a kind of drug den feel.6. There are only 2 elevators for the 26+ floors at the hotel. You have to wait a very long time for the elevator and therefore we always took the fire escape stairs.Overall we were not happy staying at this hotel and would not recommend it.",Thank you very much for taking the time out of your schedule to offer us some feedback about your recent stay with us at the Fairfield In and Suites by Marriott.I would like to extend my sincerest apology that we were not able to provide you with the levels of service we normally pride ourselves with.We have taken your concerns to the proper department heads to ensure we do not repeat this issues.Thank you again and we look forward to welcoming you back in the future.,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: December 2017,"Response from Louis G, General Manager at Fairfield Inn & Suites New York Downtown Manhattan/World Trade Center Area","Responded Dec 22, 2017",89,80.34,99.0,30.72,99.0,89.0,16.85,91.01,59.55,21.35,19.1,2.25,8.99,7.87,0.0,0.0,2.25,5.62,20.22,4.49,4.49,2.25,2.25,11.24,1.12,1.12,0.0,0.0,2.25,6.74,6.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,21.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.62,0.0,0.0,2.25,1.12,0.0,2.25,1.12,1.12,0.0,0.0,1.12,1.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.73,10.11,2.25,1.12,2.25,0.0,2.25,7.87,1.12,15.73,2.25,8.99,8.99,4.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.49,4.49,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,34.5,1.019195402298851,1.600574712643678,1.647471264367816,302.4927408823211,596.7743577190001,5.43,3.2,7.7,-0.0435301204819277,0.1323976503434174,0.2320900556995351,0.1645698912039923,0.2222035832728312,0.3646879406449733,-0.3354347826086956,0.3193783783783785,0.07158211129867602,0.0846063392059357,0.3907736894709893,0.4465384615384616,0.607076923076923,0.6954615384615387,0.01149425287356322,0.0,0.0,0.08045977011494253,0.08045977011494253,8,25.625,True,Marriot

Just a quick one night in the city, so we selected based on location and price. We generally stay at Residence Inn or Courtyards and this Fairfield was a bit of step down in terms of service from those hotels. Perhaps it's just that this is such a large hotel? Here were our issues:- Room booked for two people, arrived to find ONE set of towels in the room. We both wanted to shower on arrival after a long drive and my husband (over 6 ft tall) had to dry off with a hand towel because more towels still had not been delivered an hour after our arrival and complaint. A single additional towel was delivered at some point in the evening while we were out. I can understand extra towels taking a while to deliver, but when you don't provide enough towels for the individuals booked to stay in the room the delivery should be faster.- The sink drain is unlike any I've ever seen. We were convinced it was broken! Maybe we don't get out enough, but you have to push the drain to get it to pop up. Okay - so maybe the maid should leave it in the down position? We had a gross sink of water before we got that one sorted out with the front desk.- Allow plenty of time to get your vehicle returned from valet parking. We called ahead 15 minutes before going down and still waited another 15 min or more for the car to arrive.Overall and okay stay. I hate to be picky and complain, but the towel thing really was annoying. Breakfast buffet was decent, paper plates and plastic ware, but food was okay.","Dear RAJCNH,We are always looking for ways to amplify our services, so we thank you for taking the time to share your valuable observations.

Staff was friendly. When we arrived at the hotel, system messed up our booking, so we couldn‚Äôt keep the same room all through our 4-night stay. Staff was apologetic and upgraded us for part of the stay so that was okay.Now the bad part. The elevators! Be prepared to wait a long time for the elevators! In one occasion, I waited for 10 minutes at the basement (where the fitness center was) with no cell reception! It was frustrating! To top it all off, the hotel didn‚Äôt have separate service elevators, so hotel maids, maintenance guys, and securities would all share the same elevators with hotel guests. Imagine how crowded the elevators would be during the room cleaning time!

They did not answer, but said that i must not think that they would fool me, but that was exactly how i felt and told them so.They could have put a note on my door, or in my room to contact the reception, knock on my door or call when i was back in my room, this was a very rude way to treat your costumers, i have never experienced this kind of behavior anywhere in the world.I would chose this hotel for its location, and not chose it for the some rude check in staff, your choice.",Thank you for taking the time to share your recent experience with us.

When it opened, it was a simple but stylish budget boutique hotel. Now, it's just shabby hodge podge with an inexperienced staff. Our room had a dirty jean bedspread, dirty floors. The coffeemaker didn't work. The room AC went On and off every five minutes all night. There's perfume pumped into the rooms- I needed to have the window open always. People were up in the rooms around us until after 2am. If it were still a 'budget' hotel my expectations might be different, but at $250 a night the place should at least be clean. The best thing about the hotel is it's terrific location.","Thank you for your review .I am sad to read about your experience.

I travel with a family so I have 2 small kids (9 & 11) I wanted to try something a little more personal by staying at a 'boutique' hotel rather then big chain hotels. But unfortunately I didn't feel the personal touch that I thought you would get and It wasn't like I was saving money by staying here. Location was fabulous!! With the Grove across the road, you certainly have everything at your door step. It does have cool little things, like the bikes and books and pool with rubber duckies and 2 cute little budgies in the lobby!! It's clean, safe and a very good looking place. Room I was in was kind of out under a stair case, so no sunlight shining my room, but you can sit out on the balcony if you wanted. Does have a restaurant TART in house, so that was cool. I feel bad saying this as I have worked in hospitality before and I know it can be challenging but I feel that could have been managed better. Overall I guess I was chasing some welcoming customer service. I love the USA and I love its people and I kind of wasn't feeling it here. Just a greeting when I walk through the lobby would have made me happy. I don't want to waited on hand and foot I just wanted the odd smile. As I was leaving though I did come across Bryan at reception and five stars would go to him. In my brief conversation with him, it made my view on my stay lift a few levels ... So thank you to him.

I feel it should be free parking or at least advertise the parking ratesWe chose this one because of its apparent close proximity to the Merrick Quarter - but when we arrived there were no maps in English in reception, and the girl in Reception did not have particularly good English.We went up to the rooftop pool - it was not heated and the bar there was not open.At no time were we told where breakfast is served, how much it cost, or what time.The following morning we found out about the free trolley buses that run to the Miracle Mile, but were ot told how frequent they were or the exact route, and noone on them spoke English.We tried finding Merrick's buildings of architectural interest but despite the fact they were supposed to be close could not find them.The hotel is not located in the best of areas either (lots of small industrial units, selling and repairing cars for example). You really need a taxi or car to get around.It was not all bad. The room was comfortable, and the lady on the desk the following morning had very good English and was helpful. Could have done with her being on the desk the day before really. All in all not a stay to remember and rather a disappointing last night for our Florida adventure.

I would stay there again though. The rooms were clean and comfortable, and the food was good. So, here are the annoyances: Biggest - I received a fraud alert ""card not present"" transaction while at a UM football game. It was for an odd-amount transaction at a Best Western in Fort Lauderdale. I called and cancelled my credit card only to later learn that the owner of the Four Points also owned a Best Western and was for some reason running charges through its other hotel. More minor but still annoying: We stayed three nights. Our room was cleaned each day but our coffee inexplicably never replaced. We went down to the lobby for coffee, but the only creamers were nauseating flavored ones and no milk or non-flavored creamers. We told the front desk the first morning, but each morning there were still only flavored creamers in the lobby. Finally, on the last morning, we asked to have plain creamers delivered to our room. A housekeeper (also very nice) arrived with towels. I don't know why. When we asked her for plain creamers, she did eventually return with both coffee and creamers. The final minor annoyance was that there was an 18% gratuity added to everything at the restaurant, even the breakfast buffet. But then there was also a separate and addition tip line, leaving you to wonder if the 18% was actually going to the servers or not, which was just awkward. So enough complaining - the hotel was generally fine. I would easily have given them four stars with a few adjustments.","Thank you for taking the time to share your comments. We are delighted to hear that you enjoyed the comfort of the hotel and the guestroom. Your feedback was very helpful and we have now fixed the issue with the correct credit card transaction name. Also, we now have a variety of coffee creamers available in the lobby area and for the guestrooms. Again, thank you for your comments as they will only help us to grow and make sure the customer service that we provide with be an experience that will make you want to return.

The front desk, cleaning and restaurant staff were very pleasant, and I felt that had I had any special requests, they probably would have helped me out. As for the property itself, it is a reasonable value if you are getting a decent rate. The room was as small as I expected for a NYC hotel room, with a worse view than expected (of an alleyway). The fan was extremely loud, but worked to effectively block any and all noise. The beds were very comfortable and there were plenty of outlets. The bathroom was very, very small, with a counter that wouldn't fit much on it and an odd faucet setup that made it virtually impossible to wash one's face without getting water everywhere. But, the water pressure was excellent -- better than home! There are only two elevators, which often meant a bit of a wait. The lobby gets cramped easily during popular check in and check out times. The fitness centre has good equipment, but not much of it; however, I didn't really see more than one person there at any given time, so probably not an issue. Most importantly, the hotel was very well located -- several subway stops nearby, an easy walk to Soho, Tribeca, the Financial District and Midtown.","Dear exiledsuburban,Thank you for your honest feedback! We're glad that you enjoyed our location and staff service.

It is in excellent proximity to Theatre Row and Times Square, and none of the subways are more than a 5 minute walk. That being said, the room with two double beds was cramped. We opted for the non-daily room service and when it was cleaned, the only difference was the beds were made and we got new towels. I couldn't even tell the room had been picked up. On top of that the trash can was left outside for us to put back in. The television hardly worked, it was a 50-50 shot if you wanted to watch anything. Luckily, we didn't spend much time in the room, but if we did, it would have been frustrating. The lack of 24 hour room service was annoying as well. For a city that never sleeps, we had to take our business elsewhere when we were hungry after shows knowing the hotel would have likely been more convenient, but was not an option.The ONLY reason I'd stay there again, is for the location. Even so I'd venture to guess the Mariott might be worth the extra money.","Dear Amanda,I am so happy to read that you enjoyed our location. We are always happy when our guests can take advantage of the convenience of being so close to all that Midtown NYC has to offer.In regard to the other elements of your stay that were not as great, I do apologize.

Room service is very convenient, and though we do not offer this feature, if our bistro is open at that time, you can always order, and have your food put in a to-go container to take up to your room with you.Thank you for providing us your feedback.",Trip type: Traveled with friends,Date of stay: August 2018,"Response from Corey C, Manager at Four Points by Sheraton Midtown - Times Square","Responded Aug 28, 2018",179,36.72,91.87,58.86,90.4,35.8,16.2,91.06,60.34,21.23,14.53,5.03,3.35,5.59,0.0,0.56,6.7,3.91,15.64,12.29,4.47,6.15,1.12,18.99,3.91,1.12,1.12,0.0,1.12,6.15,5.03,1.12,0.0,0.56,0.56,13.97,0.0,1.12,0.0,0.0,6.15,0.56,0.0,1.12,1.12,1.68,2.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.56,10.06,4.47,1.68,2.23,2.23,0.56,1.68,13.97,1.12,15.08,2.23,9.5,3.35,5.03,1.12,2.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.56,0,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.0,10.61,5.03,5.03,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,67.2,1.159255319148936,1.821808510638298,1.826755319148936,317.4190174744612,599.0026929073354,5.522857142857143,2.631428571428571,6.102857142857141,-0.07388439306358381,0.1552641360266109,0.256009825764125,0.1841867905223578,0.1886205736468709,0.4021521550863512,-0.3467227722772279,0.3088472222222223,0.122837677825687,0.1895599392992633,0.2743579593998274,0.4216615384615384,0.5379076923076923,0.6606461538461539,0.04787234042553191,0.0,0.005319148936170213,0.03191489361702127,0.04787234042553191,6,26.833333333333332,True,Sheraton

Front house staff was very nice. It Wasn't what we expected for room accomodation especially for a Sheraton in Times Square. I asked and they saud all rooms are same size except for suites. It was very small compared to most all hotels we've stayed at world wide. The Bathroom was very small, shower door was a pain getting in/out, no bathroom fan, No mini fridge or microwave in rooms, so we had to request a fridge which thankfully they gave us one to keep our doggy bags of food and drinks cold. The room Tstat didnt work so ran 24/7 and didnt really get as cold as we like it at night. Told maintenance man but never looked at. Only one of two elevator seemed to be working everytime we used it, which was an issue being on 16 floor and cant walk stairs. The restaurant was only avg for breakfast and pricy; $18.99 buffet with limited selection of hot foods, ala cart $3.99 for toast, $5.99 for cold cereal, $4.99 for 4 slices of bacon. The location is great and convenient to subway and Times Square. The bed was excellent! Dont think we will be back.",Thanks for mentioning some of your concerns to us.

After flying in from Texas, we arrived earlier than the 3:00 pm check-in time. We were told to come back at 3 and our room would be ready. Well at 4:00 pm, we were finally given a key to our room. We had 4 people in our party but we're given only 1 key. When asked the clerk said they were waiting on a key order and would have some in a few hours.The room was booked for 5 nights on Booking.com. As such,when I tried to add my Marriott Rewards at check in, I was told our stay didn't qualify because it was booked through a third party. WHAT?? That's plain ridiculous. We had ordered extra towels which were not furnished so we had to ask for them again each day.The air conditioner was broken(bad thermostat) and they said they would have engineering look at it. Well, it was never fixed and all they did was try to educate me on how HVAC systems work. We roasted for 4 days...very uncomfortable.The shower head was broken and the shower wouldn't drain. Again they were informed but failed to rectify the problem. The conditioner dispenser was refilled after we complained, but was not working so nothing would dispensed.No microwave, no fridge and lighting was less than adequate.On the plus side, free bottled water each day.You have many choices for a stay downtown, so you would think they would go an extra mile to earn your business...not in this case.

I was really disappointed. The 4 bed dorms are small. There's no room for luggage which means it's left strewn across the floor. If you're on an upper floor, get used to taking the stairs because the elevators are slow. There's no ""hostel"" vibe because the bar and coffee shop are both open to the general public and there's no hostel only space to relax in beyond the kitchen so it's difficult to meet other travellers. Had the unfortunate event of having both mine and my friends food stolen from the communal fridge by another guest. It was in the fridge less than 9 hours before someone ate it and upon informing staff, were told we use the fridge at our own risk. No signs deterring guests from taking good not belonging to them. No labelling system to clearly state who's food belongs to whom. Just 3 fridges with separate dates stating the dates and times of when the fridge will be emptied by cleaning staff. This place isn't a hostel and doesn't share or encourage the hostel spirit, it's a budget hotel with shared rooms.The continental breakfast they speak of is toast, condiments and cereal. Housekeeping comes at 10am and Wales the room despite checkout being at 12pm. I had weird interactions with them about other guests not being out on time and had to remind them checkout wasn't for another few hours.As far as positives, the location is very good, some of the staff were nice, the beds do have small privacy curtains and lamps which is nice but no plug sockets.After a disappointing stay, we awoke on our final day to find the building had no water and we were hours from boarding a flight. Not something the hotel can control but the final straw for us. It was cheaper than Found Hotel but I'd definitely pay the extra for a much better and happier experience. If you're in the city to party for one night, it's good enough to just lay your head and go home.",Hello!I am sorry to hear your experience was not what you expected and very far from it.

We should have had lowered expectations, but here are the facts.First Impressions:Small lobby and not the newest of hotels. The staff was nice at check-in. Two computers and a tv in the lobby. Our hope was that the room would be nicer than the lobby.Check-in:You received a parking pass, wi-fi code, map of the area, keys, 20% off coupon for IHOP(lunch and dinner), and instructions for the shuttle that takes you close to the pier and promenade for free. They is a $25 per day incidental fee that is refunded if you don't use any of the pay for use services(they did not mention until I asked at check out).To the room:You key must be used to get to your floor. There are vending machines and an ice machine on each floor by the elevator. The rooms are okay. The sink is separate from the shower and toilet. The tv is flat screen and there is a fridge(ours would not close). They gave us two complimentary bottles of water. No carpet in the rooms which made it seem more like a two star. The mattress was extremely comfortable.The staff:We had to have our linens changed upon arrival and the bathroom ""re-cleaned""(blue soap residue from previous guest). The good thing to say is they were quick to fix and apologetic. They try and meet your request and fulfill their obligations(shuttle driver was a no show so they paid for a cab).We say we would stay there again as it was about $500 for two nights and included parking but I would prefer another hotel that had a few more amenities.","Thank you for being our guest at The Best Western Plus Gateway Hotel and taking time to provide your valuable feedback.

I stay a lot in hotels and a great hotel according to me are the hotels that the staff are glad to see me. I‚Äôm not talking about putting me on a pedestal but just making me feel welcome. The feeling I have, right or wrong, are that they are just there to get a paycheck, me as a guest are something that have to deal with. Fortunately this lack of welcoming feeling was an exception, the rest o& the staff was both friendly and made me feel welcome.The second thing they have to improve are their wi-fi. Yes there is a free wi-fi at the hotel but it‚Äôs really slow and works when it feels like it. You can get faster speed but you have to pay for this which I never did since the speed only was one of the problems. There is something wrong when the guests have to find the nearest Starbucks or Coffee & beans to be able to read the emails from their children, looking something up on the internet or read the news from home.And according to the reception you are only allowed three units per room on the wi-if. All hotels I‚Äôve stayed at the last couple of years domestic as well as international have working free wi-fi with great speed and allowing unlimited units.",Thank you for staying with us. We appreciate your comments as they can only make us better as a unit. We hope that you will give us another try and I encourage you to call me so we can discuss.

The difference in quality is pretty staggering. The House was a bit shabby with areas of the hotel smelling like rotting vegetables. Using the car park was like gaining entry to Fort Knox. The staff were its redeeming feature as they were friendly and very helpful. A/C was noisy and constantly woke you up when it clicked in. Also floors not sound insulated so heard the footsteps above. You can give most things at a hotel a pass but not creating the right conditions for the primary function of sleep is poor. However, to call it 'Galleria' is somewhat misleading as its well away from the Galleria itself and a bit of poetic licence was used in naming it. But worst of all, I booked through Agoda and I was double billed on my card as both AGODA AND THE HOTEL CHARGED ME FOR MY STAY. Trying to get my money back as I write this review but its the last time using Agoda and the last time for the Hyatt house.","Hi Russell P-I am sorry to hear you didn't enjoy your stay with us.

I ignored her and dealt with the lady who was checking me in.They must not have wanted me to have late check out as a lady walked in without knocking at 9am I didn‚Äôt have the lock on she did not speak any English then at 11am another attempted walk in and they got annoyed as they banged the door in the bolt a few times before leavings then the same thing happened at 12 the actual check out time.

But I honestly can't let anyone else have the experience we did. Our room smelled like damp, wet carpet the instant we entered it. Since it was after Hurricane Irma, we gave them the benefit of the doubt. But when we sat on the couch, we suddenly realized we had little bugs crawling all over us. Sorry, but that's totally unacceptable. We found the staff a bit underwhelming in terms of personality or a welcoming demeanor. Not one of them ever smiled. Hampton Inns may be a decent, affordable place to stay, but THIS Hampton Inn was nothing short of disgusting. If I were you, I would steer WAY clear of this place.","Dear Bob B.Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.

356,30,20.0,30.0,30.0,,,,,,,,,,apologyWhenIpulleduptoth,Hampton Inn & Suites Seattle Downtown,20,"When I pulled up to the Hampton on Queen Anne, the building was covered in scaffolding and the construction use sign was unreadable due to graffiti. I wasn‚Äôt sure if the place was open, but a construction worker encouraged me to walk through the door. The Hampton is undergoing a remodel. The building that houses the one-bedroom suites is completely closed for renovation, but the one with hotel rooms is not. The fitness center was not open. The breakfast lounge area is open even though it is in the midst of changes.There is construction going on across the street, unrelated to the Hampton, and not under their control. But the rumble of the trucks and other heavy equipment was so loud that I immediately asked staff to move me to another part of the building. Which they did. That room had a view only of scaffolding, with fire resistant covering to block light, but it was quiet. The bed was comfortable, and the shower hot. I got a good night‚Äôs sleep, which is what one expects of a hotel. However, I do expect a warning about remodeling. I never received anything in the mail and the Hilton website doesn‚Äôt mention the construction.The staff were super friendly and as accommodating as they could be under the circumstances. If not for them, I might have switched hotels. The Hampton is typically reliable, no matter the location, so I‚Äôll try them again AFTER the remodel is complete. Staff expects most of it to be done by March. By that time, the construction zone across the street will not be as much of a issue.Please note that my rating is due to the inconvenience of the remodeling, the construction noise from the street, and the lack of usable window in the room due to scaffolding. These issues are temporary. To be fair, you should call the hotel and get a status report.","Dear DigitalRabbit,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel, we rely on the wonderful feedback of our guests to continue to improve our hotel.

Booked @ the HI b/c it was new, well-ranked on this site & b/c I was using hhonors points for my first night. Arrived early and was told that the only available double rooms were accessible rooms, so I took one - as I just wanted to unwind from my traveling. Room was small, but appropriately furnished. Bathroom seemed institutional. Breakfast was just ok - nothing to write home about. Pool was just ok as well. Perhaps a theme is emerging....Was in MIA for a 3-day weekend. The next morning, after being hassled @ the front desk about receiving the govt contractor rate I reserved for the balance of my stay (& for which I qualified), I jumped ship and went to the Epic - which was admittedly more than the govt rate @ the HI, but was comparable to its prevailing room rates.Upon my arrival @ the Epic, I knew I'd selected the right spot!. The lobby is open, airy & breezy, and projects a distinct feeling and ambiance of being ""someplace more than no place."" Received an upgraded room w/ balcony overlooking the hotel's pool and the bay. The room's furnishings were sumptuous, the bathroom lavishly appointed, & the pool area felt resort-like. The staff were courteous and service-oriented. Instead of simply obtaining lodging, @ the Epic I enjoyed a 5 star experience.Would encourage travelers considering the HI to instead search hard for a good rate @ a premium property. It's well worth experiencing VIP treatment during your short stay in MIA.","Dear Jamerican1906,I apologize for not responding to your review in a timely manner. Every review is valuable for us.

The concierge was very helpful with all our questions while constantly maintaining a pleasant smile. The hotel was very clean and updated with a nice firm bed. The hotel is located in a very convenient location just a short walk to the metromover. Since we were there for a basketball game at the arena, this couldn't have worked out any better as the metromover takes you within a few blocks of the arena. We checked out early in the morning so I really can't comment on the breakfast.Now for the disappointing.. We pulled our car up to the front door of the hotel for check-in which is on the 6th floor. This was no problem as I had previously read on tripadvisor of the location of check in. The hotel has a parking garage for guests which costs $18 per night. No problem with this either as parking can be very difficult in Miami. The problem was getting to the garage. As I said we pulled the car up to the front lobby for check-in and then went back to the car to park. As soon as we pulled out, immediately next to the hotel is a parking lot entrance. We pulled in and noticed our keycard did not work so we talked into the call box and said we just checked in and our keycard didn't work. The gate opened and we parked the car. We found our way to the elevator and was somewhat confused as our keycard did not work in the elevator. Fortunately, there were other people on the elevator and we asked if we were at the Hampton since the floor numbers on the elevator seemed a little strange. We were told no so that explained why our cards didn't work. We left the parking lot and drove around to get back to the hotel, and low and behold, the parking lot entrance for the hotel is located just before pulling the car up to the front lobby. In other words, when facing the hotel, parking is to the right.One of the major disappointments of the hotel was the noise level in the room. I know there are many inconsiderate people who spend the night in a hotel and they can be extremely noisy if they hold their conversations in the hallway while people are trying to sleep. Slamming their doors is also another inherent characteristic of these people. It seemed that there was very little soundproofing throughout the room to deaden the noise level as the sound just echoes throughout the halls.If we return to the Miami area for another outing, we would probably stay at the hotel again because of its convenience, even with all the issues. However, I would definitely complain to the staff this time if there were some very annoying and disturbing people disrupting the guests.","Dear Ddddpppp,First of all, allow me to apologize for not responding to your review in a timely manner. Every individual review and opinion is extremely valuable to us.I am sorry to hear that location of the parking caused confusion; now we do have a sign outside as well as a security guard who is directing the guests upon necessity. Next time, if you would kindly complain to the front desk staff about the noise level, this way we will be able to resolve the problem. Overall, I am glad that you are eager to stay with us in the future and to give us a chance to provide you with an excellent service.We look forward to seeing and serving you again!Sincerely,Eduardo Chapoval, CHAGeneral ManagerHampton Inn & Suites Miami Brickell / Downtown50 SW 12th StreetMiami, FL 33130",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: November 2012,"Response from Eduardo C, General Manager at Hampton Inn & Suites by Hilton - Miami Brickell Downtown","Responded Feb 11, 2014",139,87.22,96.92,16.3,96.9,34.75,22.3,87.05,50.36,12.95,10.07,2.16,4.32,3.6,0.0,0.0,2.88,7.91,15.83,7.19,3.6,4.32,0.72,10.79,4.32,1.44,0.72,1.44,1.44,9.35,7.19,2.16,0.0,0.0,0.72,15.11,0.0,1.44,0.0,0.0,10.07,0.72,1.44,2.16,3.6,2.16,1.44,2.88,1.44,1.44,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.67,5.04,2.88,2.88,0.72,2.16,0.0,10.07,1.44,12.95,1.44,7.91,5.76,5.04,0.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.72,0,0.0,0.0,0.72,0.0,12.23,3.6,5.76,0.0,0.72,0.0,0.72,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.44,54.4,1.155065789473684,1.698486842105263,1.705921052631579,321.5226389149756,590.8825385488049,4.363333333333333,2.176666666666666,6.543333333333333,-0.06202222222222223,0.2017711648058891,0.3111184472123099,0.2115667238992276,0.2183481757000181,0.3049551792876886,-0.3965211267605634,0.3090625,0.176011355847083,0.2237230438138468,0.3131332983717434,0.4557,0.5700200000000001,0.64316,0.0131578947368421,0.0,0.0,0.02631578947368421,0.03289473684210526,5,28.0,True,Hilton

As we were setting down our luggage, my wife opened the curtains and saw a large bug scamper up the wall. Nope. Went back to the front desk to complain, and they said ""oh no"" and changed our room to another floor. Really felt like just finding another hotel, but it was late and the kids were tired so did not argue it with the front desk clerk.Second room was bug-free (we checked thoroughly this time before bringing our bags in). Rest of the night was OK, but noticed the floors needed a good vacuuming both in our room and the hallways.Parking garage is free but with a fortress-like gate that tells you a lot about how sketchy this neighborhood is.

You can tell from the moment you arrive outside that it isn‚Äôt going to be a pleasant experience. Walking into the lobby confirms that - it‚Äôs shabby and unwelcoming. We were given room 504, right near the lifts. I appreciate that, being so close to the airport, people will be coming and going at all hours, but there are no notices asking guests to keep the noise down in corridors and nothing done by staff to break up lengthy noisy conversations in the early hours. The room was in need of updating. It‚Äôs the first time I‚Äôve ever come across coffee making facilities in the bathroom because there was no free plug anywhere else. Not ideal when there‚Äôs more than one of you using the bathroom. The only plug socket in the room was under the desk where the lamp plugged in - you have to unplug the light to use the iron. Good job it was still daylight! And then there was breakfast. Again disappointing, especially compared with other Hampton Inns. The breakfast area is next to the exit for the pool and several people struggled to find somewhere to sit because others were leaving their things on the seats, going to the pool for a bit and coming back for more. I would rather go home a day earlier than stay here again. Don‚Äôt make the same mistake!","Whilst it is our goal every day to make every guest have a memorable experience, we also know that perception is reality.

I stayed 3 times over the last 2 weeks whilst visiting briefly on business and the room standard was consistently good. Late checkout is possible if you ask in the morning. I didn't try the breakfast so can't comment on that. They have a shuttle service which leaves every 30 minutes but I prefer to take a taxi (17 dollars fixed fare to the airport and it only takes 10 minutes max).The only negative in my experience were the front desk staff, exceptionally rude and unfriendly, even by American standards. They just grunt at you. ""Please"" and ""thankyou"" don't appear to feature in their vocabulary. It would be a good idea for Hampton Inns to undertake some customer service training as first impressions really do count.There is a shopping area across the road which has a decent Cuban restaurant in it, other than that the area is surrounded by fast food outlets. Some local ""takeout"" food companies will deliver to the hotel. Complimentary coffee and water is provided in the room.For convenient access to the airport, and a reliable product, I would recommend the hotel. If you're used to the brash, no thrills, ""you're wasting my time just by being here"" attitude of the staff, then you may even enjoy your stay! I'll give somewhere else a try next time I'm in Miami.","While we appreciate every feedback received by our guests, we need to acknowledge that our disappointment is greater than yours in your perception of poor customer service experienced by our front desk staff - and we apologize.

At first, I was very pleased with this hotel and the staff, until i checked out. The day of check out I had 4 pending charges on my credit card: $60.00, $172.12, $126.88, and $126.88. When I went to check out I asked the front desk about these charges and she stated they will all be removed and I will only be charged for the night of $126.88. Days later I check my statement and I have been charged $126.88 PLUS $172.12. I called numerous times to the hotel and left voice messages until I finally got ahold of someone. They said that they will check and contact me back. I received an email stating that the safe (which i NEVER used or touched) was ‚Äúbroken‚Äù and that is why I am being charged the extra $172. I had to follow up multiple times before getting an answer. Both managers Wilmer and David were extremely dismissive, told me there was nothing they could do, will not return my money and to contact another hotline.

Front desk lady (Diana ""Gonzalez"", more on her later), pretty sure that is a fake last name as well, did not have the correct room for me although I booked 6 months in advance. That took forever while my jet lagged family stood around and waited.Finally get a room. Room 305. All was good until my wife went to get in bed and we found the first of many bedbugs (see photo). This was the only one we caught. We brought it to the front desk in a cup and the wonderful Diana treated us rude once again and offered no help except a refund (I booked the room on points). I told her I wanted her hotel to pay for a new room next door at Embassy Suites (also in the Hilton family so easily could have been done through corporate) but she refused. Didn't even offer to shuttle us, buy a cab, nothing. Sent us out the door with all our bags into the night.Unless you want jumbo jets flying directly over, and I mean RIGHT OVER, the hotel, bedbugs, and a real treat of a staff...go somewhere else.","Hello Mr.Jeremy M,We would like to thank you for your feedback as well as offer out utmost apologies for the inconveniences experienced. As Diana explained to you upon your complaint, we have never experienced bed bugs in our hotel and we did need to perform a cross examination with our pest department to evaluate if the bugs found in your room were in fact bed bugs. When we in fact did our cross examination there were no bed bugs found in the room, the bugs found while you were in the room were cancelled out from being bed bugs the second the examination started. Regardless of that we understood your frustration and Diana did offer a free night in points which could've been used for a room at the Embassy suites. In regards to the airplane noise, we are an airport hotel located right next to the airport. Our facility does have hurricane proof windows which shield most of the noise coming from the outside, as we receive little to no complaints about noise in the rooms.Again, we do apologize for the inconveniences experienced throughout your stay.",,Date of stay: September 2019,"Response from AngieH1938, Manager at Hampton Inn Miami Airport East","Responded Oct 12, 2019",189,91.66,99.0,40.63,25.77,31.5,19.58,86.24,55.03,12.17,10.58,0.0,6.35,4.23,0.0,0.0,1.59,9.52,19.05,8.47,3.17,4.76,1.59,14.29,3.7,2.65,1.59,0.53,0.53,4.23,2.12,2.12,0.0,1.06,0.0,15.34,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.58,4.76,0.53,2.65,1.06,2.12,0.53,3.17,0.0,1.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.94,6.88,0.0,1.06,0.0,0.0,8.47,4.23,0.53,16.93,1.59,12.17,4.23,1.59,1.06,5.29,0.53,0.0,0.0,0.53,0,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.0,7.94,4.23,3.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.53,0.0,0.0,73.9,1.067611940298507,1.461840796019901,1.497562189054726,337.4304902147795,583.3321916827525,4.193333333333333,2.406666666666666,5.199999999999999,0.004275132275132268,0.2226302976849879,0.2114086480895276,0.2527518054057762,0.2151213244297744,0.2152179412950508,-0.370768292682927,0.2916915887850466,0.08817945856729663,0.2305823430906696,0.2745470327949143,0.4787580645161292,0.538467741935484,0.602774193548387,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.05970149253731343,0.03980099502487562,3,22.666666666666668,True,Hilton

This one is an exception both ways.Efficiency: I struggled to determine the best way to get to the hotel as it is not directly situated at the airport. After a 40 minute wait.( shuttle will be there in ten minutes, shuttle will be there any minute,...) I took a taxi for the 4 minute ride. Cost 17.50. Total time 44 min. Which is no fun after a long day and a three hour flight. Not, when the hotel is actually 4 minutes away....The receptionist reimbursed me with 17 bucks in cash. After I refused to accept (as it does not bring back the wasted time and the missed sleep) I accepted a breakfast voucher.Room was spacious and immaculate. Good sleep. Worth 200$ for 'just' a clean room? Not so sure. But ok.Breakfast staff was of this unnatural/ artificial friendliness that I still have trouble to get used to in the US.I presented my breakfast voucher and ordered a scrambled egg. Had a cup of coffee and a slice of tast from the buffet along with a glass of orange juice.My surprised: a $16.50 bill. If I add the $17 from the voucher that would be over $30 for a mediocre breakfast.","Dear Eugen G,Thank you for your review here on TripAdvisor.

Love Hiltons brand and the Gardens are probably my favorite.Almost everything about this hotel was outstanding. Close to the airport and the rail... Making it very easy to get into the city. I prefer that style of stay.This part might not concern you directly but hang in there. We had a wheelchair accessible room, roll in shower etc. it was perfect for my wife who is in a wheelchair... Until we we had to take a shower. The water ran everywhere except for the drain... I was taking towels from the housekeeping cart and was literally mopping up soapy water for 3 days. Imagine stepping out of the shower into what just fell off of you.Here's where this might concern you.I told the front desk about the issue and they were concerned for sure. I received a call a few hours later asking if we wanted to change rooms. I said no, let's just credit us on the room. We were going to be out until midnight and our stuff was all over, we didn't want to move rooms in the middle of the night when we were checking out in the morning.We received approx. $40 credit a night, which was nice but not enough. The GM was not in, so I asked for he or she to give me a call. The front desk wrote this down on a notepad. It has now been a week, and I have not received a call.There is a advertisement on the desk in these rooms. It says, ""100% Satisfaction guaranteed or your money back."" I'm not asking for my money back... But certainly a little more than I was offered considering the situation.Customer service is a forgotten skill. Sometimes it's just a phone call and sometimes it's just decent follow through.The staff, front desk, restaurant and housekeeping were excellent, so were the drivers of the shuttles. Still hoping I hear from the GM.","Dear Wescoach41,Thank you for sharing your experience and we are truly sorry! We strive to exceed expectations for all our guests and we apologize that we fell short during your stay.

What an absolute mess! The front desk staff and management is so confused and management extremely rude! I was here for 3 nights each day we encountered different issues. From the beginning: I booked 4 rooms online on 6/21/19 all under my name (the hotel opened end of May) for a football weekend with 6 of our closest friends. Upon visiting my daughter who lives across the street from the hotel I walked over and spoke to a front desk clerk named Shannon (who no longer works there). She was very kind, offered me pre-reserved room numbers and breakfast for 2 each day for all days and rooms I reserved. I called the Wednesday before arriving to confirm, spoke to Michael the assistant front desk manager who told me ""We don't offer free breakfast, however I can change your reservation to the Homewood Suites (in the same building) who does. I don't think so as I had very good rate for grand opening and at the time the rooms were an extra $100.00 per night. Good Try Mike!. I thought the free breakfast was a perk of being a new guest in their new hotel, wrong! Fast forward, to the day before check in day, I called again to the front desk manager, Lorena to inquire again. Left a voice mail she never returned my call. On check in day, Lorena checked us in I asked why I didn't receive a return call no response. Went on to explain the whole Shannon/Michael/breakfast thing. She said the same thing no notes on my reservation but she reluctently gave us vouchers for breakfast. Thank you Lorena, it's not a big issue, however when you are your groups travel agent and promise them something that is promised to you it looks bad on everyone. On to check in, yes we did receive our rooms as promised they were all very nice. Only 2 of the 4 rooms were available at the 3pm check in promised. Was told housekeeping was short handed. Not our issue. Our last group checked in at 5:15 even though we all arrived together. While checking in a desk clerk changed the main name to another friend of mine on all 4 reservations. This created a MAJOR nightmare with questions and check in etc. On to Saturday, a housekeeper seen us leave at 8:50am, we told her we would all like our rooms cleaned as we would be out the most part of the day. Reutrned at 2:00pm not one of our 4 rooms were touched? Called the housekeeping supervisor who sent up extra towels no apology nothing! Went at 2:10 pm to the restuarant for a sandwich, thought it would be easier than room service. Nope the Restaurat manager told me to return at 5pm as they just closed. REALLY?? I had dinner reservations elsewhere no thanks. After dinner on Saturday night came back to our hotel bar with one very confused bar tender. 7 of the 8 of us in attendance, all ordered one drink. Never received a bill asked for one twice. He was making up prices as he went from person to person then when we started questioning him he was returning change to some of us not all. All the time that same Restaurant manager from lunch looked on. How professional is that? We had multiple other issues (I have already written to much) You get the idea of what a mess this place is. Michael even had the audasity to question and insult me in front of his other hotel guests. Once arriving at home I called Hilton Corporate immediately. Explained everything that happened and yes they restored my faith in the Hilton Brand once again. It was sad that it took that to get any resolve. The best part was I received an email from Taylor Smith asking if I wanted to discuss further with him on 11/13/19. I left him a voicemail that yes I did, it's now 11/20/19 still waiting on that return call. This hotel has multiple issues to fix before I ever return there which is sad as it is the perfect location. However from this day forward I will be staying at the Palmer House Hilton. The best hotel in Chicago, maybe this staff needs to go down the street for some proper training. So very sad for such a beautiful new hotel.","tsjkbart,Thank you for taking the time to let us know about your experience. While we understand that a dual branded hotel can be a new concept to many guests, I assure you the amenities between the two hotels do differ. While offering free breakfast since we are a new property sounds like an exciting option, it was not an option that our hotel has used. I am pleased that the team offered you the breakfast.

Our baby peed in a bed and they charged us a lot of money for that (they just added it to our bill). The next day the spot was gone (they cleaned it) but still charged us. We were suppose to stay for 25 days but after 3 days we checked out and moved across the parking lot to Four Points by Sheraton. We will never stay in a Hilton again. Marriott by far exceeds Hilton in terms of experience, staff etc.","Dear Reviewer,Since you review is for a stay back in July 2018 and anonymous it makes it hard to track down what exactly happened. It is a fact that when there is damage in the room, a recovery fee is charged. In the case mentioned, it is our responsibility to properly sanitize the mattress in respect to all our future guests that will eventually occupy that room. Besides the cost of the cleaning of the mattress, the room will remain out of service until it is suitable for use again. We understand that accidents happen and we are sorry for the inconvenience but the hotel shouldn't have to absorb the cost of something that is beyond the normal usage of a hotel room.Kind regards,Mauricio MartinsArea General Manager",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: July 2018,"Response from MMartinsGM, General Manager at Hilton Garden Inn Miami Airport West","Responded May 26, 2019",130,89.9,82.21,17.46,39.52,26.0,21.54,87.69,56.92,13.08,3.85,0.0,3.08,0.77,0.0,0.0,9.23,11.54,16.92,9.23,4.62,3.85,0.77,14.62,3.08,0.0,1.54,0.77,0.77,3.85,2.31,1.54,0.0,0.0,0.77,6.92,0.0,1.54,0.0,0.0,8.46,0.77,2.31,1.54,0.77,2.31,0.77,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.92,3.85,0.77,2.31,0.0,0.0,0.77,10.77,3.08,15.38,0.77,10.0,6.15,3.85,1.54,4.62,2.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.46,3.85,3.85,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.77,0.0,0.0,51.6,1.133309352517986,1.654676258992806,1.583525179856115,314.263067904742,597.899414821637,4.05,1.03,3.47,-0.05871875000000001,0.2548426979305384,0.2255731586093967,0.180864334822863,0.2350642049768308,0.165850135409622,-0.4316101694915253,0.2601304347826087,0.1179280402403611,0.2067136966972098,0.4306045103625931,0.4051363636363636,0.5414772727272728,0.5907272727272727,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.02877697841726619,0.007194244604316547,5,-12.2,False,Hilton

The hotel looks new, though the breakfast area hadn‚Äôt been fully cleaned from the night before when we were there early in the morning. The rooms are a good size and, despite being near a busy road, not noisy. The clientele, though, seems quite a bit more downscale that the Hampton Inn Brickell. But the real drawback to this HGI is the location. It‚Äôs fine for getting to/from the airport but otherwise there is nothing around the hotel. You can walk about 25 minutes to the part of Brickell with all the restaurants (many of which seem to have closed in the past year) but, if you‚Äôre not up for a long walk, you have to take an Uber to get anywhere. There is nothing around this hotel but apartment buildings. Would we come back to this hotel? Maybe, if it was just for one night. But if you‚Äôre looking to enjoy Miami, the location of this hotel is only about one step up from staying next to the airport.",We appreciate you taking the time to provide us with such candid feedback of your stay.

Good location, nice rooms. Many folks in our office stay here when in town.I was horribly bitten up by bed bugs. It's a week later and I am still miserable covered in painful welts, 24 of them!It took me a day to realize what had happened and called my hilton honors number. Lots of jockeying around, got someone live I explained to, no apology whatsoever just told to please hold. I listened to music for a while and then call was just dropped. I then used their online form to lodge the complaint. I got an email response confirming my feedback indicating the local hotel would contact me live in 2 days. No one ever contacted me.I've been a pretty loyal Hilton traveler but after having my first problem and seeing how it was handled I am really going to think twice before booking one again.","Thank you for taking the time to share your experience about your recent stay at our hotel.We sincerely appreciate your feedback and first and foremost we are very sorry hear that you were unhappy with your experience and and we did not exceed your expectations.With regard to your concern about potential bed bugs, this is the first incident that I have ever heard of at this property.

Nice bar (with happy hour) and restaurant to include room service. Room was postage stamp sized, but had a nice view. Very clean and modern, Keurig coffee maker, microwave, and fridge. The staff was also very nice and attentive. Cons: King sized bed was way too firm and not adjustable as many HGI's offer. Mattress rested on a hard wooden framed flat box (on the floor) without a box-spring. Wooden bed frame extended beyond the perimeter of the mattress, with hard, sharp corners that bruised our shins and feet several times throughout the night when moving around the room. Parking (valet only) was ~$50, which was painful, but not unusual for Seattle. The hotel offered many attractive amenities, but to me, a comfortable mattress that I don't bruise myself on throughout the night weights heavily. Investing in comfortable mattresses and rubber baby buggy bumpers for the bed frame corners would elevate my rating to ""very good"" and prompt my return. Barring that, I'm not likely to stay again.",Thank you for taking the time to write a review about your recent stay at our hotel.

Mirror had a CRUDE message written on it that appeared in the fog after a shower. My daughter saw it, not cool at all. Overall the room was dusty.Swimming pool is only 3 feet deep. It's made for little kids. LOUD little kids. The hot tub is big but as you can guess ALL the adults are in it to avoid the screaming water fight in the pool.Valet only parking is spendy $50 but I know, parking is expensive anywhere downtownGood:Lobby nice, bar nice (didn't use it), restaurant for breakfast was awesome.

I loved the pool (I didn't get to use it but the view was spectacular).However I was very disappointed with how this hotel and the reservations line handled the issue I had. I called the hotel to make a change to my reservation and was diverted to the reservations line. I had prepaid my rate and was requesting to change the date of the reservation. The first agent I spoke to told me I could change the reservation and to call back when I had a specific date. The second person I spoke to told me that they couldn't change the reservation and that I was pretty much screwed. They said I could speak to the hotel but wouldn't do so on my behalf. The third person I spoke to told me I could, then proceeded to change, the reservation, give me a date, and price. I was satisfied until I woke up the next morning to an email that my reservation had been cancelled. I received another email from the front desk supervisor of the hotel that a cancellation rate had been applied to my card because I cancelled the room. Since I was in Florida, I decided to stay in the hotel and ask to speak with the front desk supervisor. I waited in the lobby for 45 minutes for the supervisor to go the desk and the go back to the office and not come out to see me. I had to return to the desk again to request the supervisor to speak with them. One he came out he told me that there wasn't much he could do since I cancelled the reservation, even though I never did. I ended up having to call the Front Desk Manager the next day (even though I was told them would reach out to me) to get this all resolved. Due to all of this I didn't truly get to experience all the amenities of the hotel. You guys honestly lost money from me since I would have visited the bar and restaurant.","Thank you for your feedback 457allen.We are glad that you enjoyed the property so much, especially the pool! We are, however, disappointed to hear about your experience with the reservation line. It seems like there was a lot of confusion, and I'm sure that was extremely frustrating for you.

It is a beautiful and new hotel and our experience at the front desk and with the valet who showed us around the hotel was great. Just Ok experience at the bar and issues with housekeeping that were dealt with appropriately before we left. Unfortunately, my experience with management (Fernando) and catering was AWFUL shortly after our stay. I was inquiring about having a large event and Rosie (a receptionist)was obnoxious. I tried to report it to Fernando (the hotel manager) and he could not have handled it worse. He was condescending, he would not let me speak, and he had all the facts wrong because he was a know-it-all. He was just rude and horrible. I am completely shocked Hilton would allow someone like him to be manager. I am in Miami 5-6 times a year. Would have made this one of my go-to hotels but because of the rudeness of these two employees I refuse to stay there until they don‚Äôt work there anymore. We obviously decided not to have the event of 100-150 ppl there and thank goodness we discovered how management is before booking the event. They missed out on us booking the event and all the hotel rooms booked for the event over a long weekend. That‚Äôs a lot of missed revenue. I would have rated higher for the stay but my experience after our stay was so bad I can‚Äôt rate it higher knowing management treats people this way. It is unacceptable. It‚Äôs too bad because it‚Äôs a nice hotel. I also don‚Äôt think charging $15 per night for parking is appropriate for this location. I was such a Hilton fan before this...I hope they fix these issues and we can try this out again with new staff one day. Like I said before...it‚Äôs too nice of a hotel to see it go downhill because of a few bad apples. I know from many stays at other Hilton properties that Hilton can do better and that especially Fernando (but also Rosie)are not up to par with Hilton hospitality. Super unfortunate it ended up this way.","Thank you for taking the time to share your concerns with us, Julie,We regret that your experience with us has been anything less than ideal and that our team didn't go above and beyond to accommodate your needs.

Found out the shuttle was independently operated not related to the hotel.The airport shuttle was efficient since this hotel was only less than five minutes from the terminal. Check-in was friendly and efficient, and the property was bright, clean and well kept. However, we soon found out that sound proofing within the room was poor. I had been staying in other airport hotels that did a much better job in sound proofing. The room's housekeeping was done well, and the bed was comfortable. Wifi worked without issues and the air conditioning was OK. The included breakfast was above average. The hotel management and staff were well aware of the lacking of dining providers nearby - only one Subway at the gas station across the street and one average Cuban restaurant within five minute walk. Hotel might consider providing transportation to better restaurants or suggesting some take out places. There was one homeless at the Subway parking lot and one at the hotel parking lot, pandering for money. It made the walk to the sandwich store in the evening a little uncomfortable. Staff did not mention there were other restaurants further out that would do deliveries. I did not realize this until I was on the way back from Subway when I saw a pizza delivery car pulled up to the hotel front.Overall, if one does not mind about the almost constant jet planes' taking off or taxiing noise, this would easily be a four/five star place.","Thank you for being our guest. We are glad you could take advantage of our shuttle service and that you were impressed with our comfortable accommodations.

They have ""tried"" to fix the problem by putting in stick on grippy tape on the floor of the tub, but only three thin strips and quite far from each other so this really wasn't sufficient.

It was convenient for those purposes, but it's not really near anything else people might want to visit in Seattle.The neighborhood the hotel is located in is a little sketchy with lots of marijuana shops, auto part stores, pawn shops and the like surrounding it on a busy stretch of Aurora Ave. Once inside, however, it feels nice and has been upgraded nicely. The lobby is warm and inviting with a fireplace and large breakfast area, and the rooms are spacious and very well-appointed. Our bed was comfy in our King Efficiency Suite and we had plenty of room to spread out--except in the bathroom. It would be nice to cut into the room space a bit to expand the bathroom, or to put the vanity area outside the shower/toilet area. It's not a two-butt bathroom, that's for sure. :) But it was nicely decorated and had nice amenities and big, fluffy towels, so I will give them positive reviews for that.Our room was comfortable and had everything you could need. I liked the decor and the lay-out.The breakfast was quite good with lots of choices (cold and hot) and plenty of room for guests. No complaints there. I found the staff to be very helpful and accommodating throughout our stay.My biggest complaint would be the internet service. Although it was free, it was really bad throughout the hotel--so bad that I decided to go downstairs and use the business computer (located in the corner of the eating area) for a bit. THAT was even worse. It literally took me half an hour to bring up my airline confirmation and print a boarding pass. I wouldn't recommend trying to do any sort of business here, as you will be very frustrated.Other than that and the location, I would recommend this hotel for the customer service and the nice decor and free breakfast and free parking. It's a good choice if you need a place to stay in the north part of Seattle.","Thank you so much for your candid review of our hotel. I am pleased to hear you enjoyed your stay with us and found our hotel comfortable and inviting. It's something our staff takes great pride in, so we value your feedback. We hope that when you visit your family you will stay with us again.Sincerely,Chloe S.Sales and Marketing Manager",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: September 2015,"Response from HIEXhotelStaff, Manager at Holiday Inn Express Hotel & Suites North Seattle - Shoreline","Responded Oct 9, 2015",63,7.35,99.0,4.97,99.0,15.75,14.29,93.65,53.97,30.16,25.4,1.59,11.11,12.7,0.0,0.0,4.76,0.0,9.52,4.76,6.35,9.52,0.0,17.46,3.17,0.0,1.59,0.0,1.59,14.29,14.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,28.57,1.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.76,1.59,0.0,1.59,3.17,0.0,0.0,1.59,0.0,1.59,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.63,12.7,1.59,3.17,3.17,0.0,1.59,12.7,3.17,9.52,4.76,4.76,3.17,7.94,4.76,1.59,3.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.7,7.94,3.17,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.59,0.0,0.0,24.3,1.283731343283582,1.919850746268657,2.009253731343283,329.2186661024238,586.754045628983,5.19,2.932,7.432,0.1473225806451613,0.1162986455871571,0.2065560475593487,0.16187492751052,0.1823208209595676,0.300387267080922,-0.189258064516129,0.4839032258064516,0.07748578597049924,0.312022031228583,0.3265381398853144,0.4409999999999999,0.6118260869565216,0.7746086956521738,0.01492537313432836,0.0,0.0,0.1044776119402985,0.1194029850746269,5,-30.0,False,Intercontinental

He told me they release the deposit 3 to 5 days after you check out. I understand deposits but why they need to keep them for up to 5 days I dis not understand. The room was ok but scaffolding and workers meant the shades had to be pulled except at night when they were not working.. The pool was under construction. The parking lot is a nightmare and the neighborhood is not one I would take a stroll in.,"Dear Dmempt,Thank you for sharing feedback.We appreciate honesty as it grants us the possibility to understand areas of opportunity and areas of success. I can imagine the frustration with our deposit requirement. At point of check out, our system releases funds but the transition for a bank to accept this action can take days. This is normal for all hotels, but I completely understand your perspective. The deposit is a measure Hotels take for property security as well extending freedom to their patrons in terms of dinning and other available amenities they choose to partake.In relationship to renovations, I am happy to report our building enhancements have been completed. Within a few weeks, all upgrades will be finalized and hope you can visit us again soon.

We came as a family of 4, 2 grown children at ages 18/15. The location of the hotel is excellent. Check in took minutes and we proceeded to room. The hotel has approx 20 floors we were a third way up. No issue in using lift. On entering the ""family room"" immediately you felt that the area was going to be cramped. Our view from our window was generators of building roof tops which were making a noticeable voice. Our children moaned immediately on entering and we knew this was going to be hard work for a 7 night stay. Also the room smelt stale, didnt feel fresh. The toilets were a sliding door from main room which again was not ideal. The bathroom was clean and functional. I did try and change the room but no other were available and after we had started our NYC site seeing plan we just put up with it as we were using the room to just sleep in. Breakfast was good overall, 4 hot choices, 2 types of egg and 2 types of sausages (pork / turkey). We were limited to vegetarian so could have eggs only, but good selection of bread/cereals/yoghurts and they had a self serv pancake maker. Good selection of Coffee/Tea/Juices. The reception are ok, but at the end I wasn't asked about our stay, to which I feel they are not bothered. The strongest part of this hotel is its location. 8 mins to Time Sq 4 mins to a variety of Subways worked great for us. Overall I would give 3.5 for this hotel. My recommendation is, it is ideal for a couple or a single person but definitely cramped for a family of 4 in a family room. If I was going to New York again as a family I would consider other options and pay extra for the space.","Hi Ibuzi,Thank you for sharing your recent experience at our hotel.

All though was not acknowledged or thanked for being a platinum rewards card holder when checking in. The hotel is newly renovated. The decor is very nice. Rooms are clean and average. Booked a room with fridge and microwave but our room seemed to not have one for some reason. Beds are comfortable as Holiday Inn beds usually are. There are very nice ice buckets in the rooms and also signs on each floor that say ice machine to imply they have ice for your convenience. But after going from floor to floor down each hall they do not. And apparently this has been a problem for some time . The terrace on the second floor is a great place to relax. The Burger restaurant is great. They actually have turkey burgers on the menu which is fabulous. Parking is not free. $18 a day for self parking. When checking out make sure to check the charges the hotel has charged you. Had several problems with the bill. And unauthorized charges on my credit card. Has been three days so far that we are still trying to straighten it out. Love the Holiday Inn brand hotels so I hope this hotel can work out its kinks.,"Thank you for sharing your experience with us. I am happy to hear that overall you did enjoy your stay. I do apologize for the issues you encountered while here. I know that the billing issue was resolved yesterday. As for the ice machines, we do currently have them on order and are awaiting their arrival. In the meantime, there is one located on the second floor or our guests can contact room service and they will deliver it for them. I will personally address your not being recognized as a platinum member with the associate who checked you in.

We told reception and she said she would tell the cleaners to keep an eye out but it didn‚Äôt stop them from smoking in their room still.Location is good it‚Äôs close to the subway stations.Hotel is clean and tidy and the cleaners do a good job in the rooms.There is a long wait for the lift the lower the floor you are - we were on floor 36 and the lower we went the more crammed the lift got which meant people on the lower floors had to continuously wait for the next lift. I‚Äôd request a higher room if possible.One of the main reasons for the low score is the breakfast - we didn‚Äôt realise there was a buffet upstairs until day 3. We were told by one person that it would be $3 extra per person which we were happy to pay, we then complained about it to reception as the ‚Äòcrispy‚Äô potatoes tasted like they had been left out for a few days, the scrambled egg was green (not an exaggeration!), the bread was stale and there was mouldy fruit on the side. The atmosphere was non existent, it was cold and quiet and just not very nice. Most definitely not worth $3 extra!! Reception said that this was included in our stay which was fine as we were certainly not going back up there. On our final day when we paid for our stay, the receptionist said that we had to pay the $6 for our breakfast as it wasn‚Äôt included in the stay. After explaining why we were not happy to pay for it she finally waived it.I‚Äôd advise not going upstairs to the buffet as it is the same food as the al a carte, just a few days older.The standard of the rooms are nice and the bed was SO comfy and big. The view from our room was AMAZING. We were overlooking the Hudson River and the World Trade Centre, which was a five minute walk away.The hotel did a lovely gesture after we got engaged and did a beautiful towel arrangement on the bed, which was very thoughtful.I would stay here again but only if I was guaranteed a high room.","It was a pleasure having you as our guest on your special day. We are glad to know you enjoyed our prime location, comfortable accommodations, and fantastic views. Thank you for acknowledging our Housekeeping team for a job well done.

Bad bathroom utilities like shampoo/ body lotion; dental kit not readily available;2. Pathetic WiFi speed (4 Mbps) sometimes went as low as 2 mbps;3. Lack of basic amenities like water kettle;4. Most of all ATTITUDE OF HOTEL STAFF IS NON HELPING:a. They didn't give us the free breakfast for first 5 days and we had to buy from outside (even though it was prepaid with the room);b. We had to wait for check-in from 8 am till 3 pm (6 hours), even after paying for the day before (hotel still didn't refund one night charges);c. No fridge / refrigeration available for guests.Really bad experience with Holiday Inn. I have been staying with Sheraton, Hilton in NYC for 5 years but never had this worst experience.","Greetings Anishsaxena1990,While we appreciate all of our guests staying with us I am not sure you have the correct hotel. Please allow me to respond to each of your commetns and then you decide if this is the correct hotel as there is another Holiday Inn and a Holiday Inn Express on Wall Street not far from here. We are often confused with those hotels.1. Our bathroom amenities are from Bath & Body Works and of the some of the best quality. Not sure what you are referring to for the ""dental kit."" We have toothbrushes and toothpaste available for free at the front desk. All you need do is ask.2. Our wifi speed is 200mps up and down which exceeds by the brand standard by 100mps.3. There are Keurig coffeemakers in each room with a nice selection of coffees and teas and plain hot water should you like that option.4. As you can see from every other review, our staff offers the best in guest service. I would appreciate you letting me know to whom you are specifically referring to from our staff.a. As with all Holiday Inns, breakfast is not included in the rate. We do have a breakfast package which allows you to purchase at time of booking at a reduced price.b. Not sure about this, so more details are needed.c. Fridges are not standard with Holiday Inns. We do however have some available for a small fee. All you need do is ask.Again, as you can see none of this makes sense, so I ask you to verify that you had the correct hotel. I am not disputing any of your comments, but feel that you have the wrong property.If so, then please allow me to make this right for you. Upon your next stay please call me directly at 646-838-5070 (my personal cell phone number) and I will make sure to take care of everything for you.",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: February 2018,"Response from Greg R, General Manager at Holiday Inn Manhattan - Financial District","Responded Feb 19, 2018",333,59.12,91.63,18.48,87.53,17.53,15.62,89.49,55.26,16.52,12.01,3.0,3.3,5.71,0.0,0.0,4.5,5.11,15.02,9.01,3.3,6.61,2.4,14.41,4.8,2.1,1.2,2.1,3.9,5.71,4.5,0.9,0.3,0.3,0.0,13.81,0.0,0.6,0.0,0.0,15.62,2.4,1.8,2.1,2.4,4.5,3.6,1.8,0.6,0.3,0.6,2.7,0.9,0.0,0.0,1.8,7.51,3.6,0.9,3.0,0.9,0.3,0.9,12.91,0.9,8.71,0.6,6.31,2.4,2.1,5.41,1.2,1.2,0.0,0.0,0.3,0,0.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.71,7.21,2.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.6,0.6,0.0,0.6,0.3,124.9,1.020310734463276,1.585875706214689,1.614774011299435,322.474257701147,596.855966121278,4.597777777777778,2.787777777777778,6.227777777777776,-0.01524923076923078,0.1678730251919842,0.2661569185187635,0.1714004281225824,0.1682333809475459,0.2890894294952351,-0.2933060109289617,0.3430915492957745,0.1150469928996585,0.145227149781725,0.2520687426717664,0.3870000000000001,0.5278640776699027,0.674029126213592,0.02824858757062147,0.0,0.0,0.03107344632768361,0.05367231638418079,4,-9.5,False,Intercontinental

We were assigned room 4505 which has a great view and is a good size for two people. Location is great and the staff at the front desk are all helpful and professional. While there were always large crowds waiting for the elevator, it never took more than a couple of minutes to get into one of three of the spacious elevators. My only disappointment and the reason for the rating, is the room not being properly cleaned, before our arrival or while we stayed at the hotel. There were hairs in the tub, dust in the furniture and headrest and a soiled bedspread, this last one prompted my travel companion to complain to the reception. They took note but when we got back to the room instead of changing the bedspreads, the cleaning staff removed them. Minimum cleaning and no supervision is happening here....This is an unfortunate example of how a good location, professional reception staff and other ‚Äúpluses‚Äù are eclipsed by lack of cleaning and attention to detail.","Thank you for choosing our hotel and for sharing your experience.

The staff were friendly and helpful at a very busy time of year. They were going to get us two rooms on one floor, but somehow this was mixed up and we had rooms on different floors which is not great when the elevators are so busy, but we got our exercise. Rooms on 3 and 8 - neither had a view of any description - one was a back alley, one was onto 26th. Surprised not to find a safe in either room. One had an ice bucket, one did not. Ice worked on 15th floor not 9th. Wifi was patchy, but not a problem. Rooms were clean. Same issue with coffee as previous reviewer - each day we were left two decaf and one regular, but front desk provided more regular. This was our 7th trip to NYC and we love morning walks. Unfortunately, we were on 29th St and had our first brush with danger - one of the homeless people walked right up and took a swing at one of us - dodged it - totally unprovoked and clearly mental health issues, but it was a reality check for us. Walked to Chelsea Market. Subway close. Walked to Macys. Beds were very comfortable. Halls are loud and there was a lot of weed drifting through the halls (not the hotel's fault, just an observation).","Hi GeoRoadWarriors,Thank you for your stay and for taking the time to share your experience with us.

Front desk was nice, helpful. I had requested a king size room upgrade online, but when we got to the room, there were 2 double beds. I was tired, didn't want to go back down. The room itself is run down, dirty. Our room had left over water bottle caps on the headboard...a dirty towel...room itself was dark. It just felt old, musty and dirty. Bed was comfy, pillows comfy so that was nice. We got a good nights sleep.We had a room that had a view of the main street which was nice. Friday morning we woke up and saw the blue sky and palm trees. We decided to walk across the street and do some shopping. It was really windy. Had lunch at the shopping complex which was really a tourist trap.We ordered an Uber Saturday morning to get to the port. It was convenient. It was a disaster for people waiting for cabs. Long line and only one person helping...it was chaos. Oh the hotel has only one restaurant and it doesn't stay open late...It's fine to stay for a night I suppose and conveniently located. The price was reasonable...it's just dirty and run down. Traveled with my husband and 5 + 3 year old. My parents had a room 2 doors down from us. Hotel rooms seemed more like a motel. The lobby and stuff is fine though. Stayed here since we joined the IHG club a couple years ago. We got a slightly better price than what was offered online.",We appreciate the feedback.It's unfortunate your time with us was less than ideal.

I understand that there can be some misunderstanding in the chain hotel business between reservations and the actual property. I attempted to book this property online and being a veteran and state employee from Michigan I used the govt. discount option. I am coming into Miami from Michigan in May. I was given a govt. rate of $119 but that was only for Canadian Govt. employees. Nothing against our friendly neighbors but the US govt. discount was $219. I tried to contact reservations on their chat. After quite a pause I was told that there were no rooms available for that date. I told them that I was looking right at the reservation online and they had several rooms available. I closed out the chat and then called the reservation number. At first they told me that I would not be able to use the govt. discount. She said she could save me a room at the regular rate and I could cancel and re-book if it lowered. I told her that would not be necessary unless it was at the govt. rate. I want to make one thing clear. I am not cheap and don't expect something for nothing but to me I can't for the life of me understand why the Canadian govt. discount would be $100 cheaper a night. I could see if it was a few dollars. Then for them to tell me that the hotel was completely booked that date was an outright lie. Can someone enlighten me on these practices? Is this normal?,"Thank you for taking the time to reach out to us, Erik.Please contact us directly at reservations@interstatehotels.com so we may look at this further and be of assistance.

It was $8 per person).2. If you want fast food....McDonalds is just behind the hotel.3.If you want liquor, there is a liquor store a block away adn there is a CVS a block away.Hope this helps!","Hello Slfree47,Your review about our Holiday Inn Port Of Miami-downtown is appreciated.

We just wanted to rest but when we got into the room, the first thing we noted was that the bedding was dirty, from the quilt to the pillow cases, also the mirrors in the bedroom and the bathroom, everything was stained like someone had just used it. In the kitchen the microwave and the refrigerator were also dirty in the outside. We called the front desk and instead of moving us to another room, the manager came over to clean it. That was about 30 minutes sitting in the couch waiting for her to do it, besides the inconvenience, we felt embarrassed to be there watching her to do everything; I kept apologizing for her even knowing that it should have been done before I was there. We were so tired, but there was no condition to get even laid down on the bed the way it was. After that we started to notice a lot of details like the window handle was broken, so we couldn‚Äôt open it. The forks, knifes and spoons were all dirty. The bathroom light was broken so sometimes when we were showering the light went off but as I just wanted to rest, I cleaned part of the stuff myself and didn‚Äôt complaint anymore about the other stuff.A little detail is that my fianc√© called asking about the amenities in the room, the receptionist told us that there would be toothpaste, but there wasn‚Äôt, so I didn‚Äôt came with one and needed to get out at night to buy it.Also, the room that they put us in was in front of some construction on the other side of the street, so we could hear the workers doing their job. And the walls of the building feel like are thin, because you can hear a lot of noise from the other rooms and also from the street.The breakfast space is small. Two days of our stay we needed to wait (holding the dishes) for someone to finish so we could sit down to eat. One of the ladies helping in the breakfast area was great, the one that was there almost all of the days, worked really hard and the staff was friendly. And the breakfast options was good! It is not all bad things but We are used to use Homewood's suites/Hilton hotels and from now on we feel like we should consider other options.

All Hilton hotels in Houston except for this location changed their rate to $120/night. I called hotel directly to ask if they would honor the new government/military rate of $120 and they said no. They explained that they were not interested in honoring the revised lower rate. What a shame.... they would rather take the chance of not booking a room that night than to take $11 less to give it to someone from the government/military. Gold or Diamond status makes no difference to this hotel either. Plenty other good hotels in Houston so, I will look elsewhere.","Mr. Mike,Thank you for taking the time to provide us your feedback. We understand your concern regarding the government rate offered at our location. I am hoping to clear up any confusion regarding how we offer the GSA for Houston. The rate is offered based on availability, for example other hotels will close out their government rates as they are nearing a sellout, so we leave it available at a discounted rate. The government discount is still a significant savings over our standard rate available.Lynda C.",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: June 2019,"Response from Explorer30976685510, General Manager at Homewood Suites By Hilton Houston Memorial","Responded Jun 26, 2019",88,89.47,99.0,19.82,68.66,17.6,28.41,79.55,50.0,15.91,13.64,1.14,6.82,3.41,0.0,2.27,2.27,9.09,15.91,5.68,3.41,3.41,0.0,13.64,2.27,1.14,1.14,0.0,1.14,2.27,2.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,17.05,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.09,1.14,2.27,1.14,3.41,1.14,1.14,1.14,1.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.77,6.82,0.0,5.68,1.14,1.14,0.0,9.09,2.27,13.64,1.14,10.23,2.27,4.55,1.14,0.0,3.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.36,7.95,3.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.7,1.196947368421053,1.636421052631579,1.676526315789474,320.2579094279037,579.3059118442168,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.217629213483146,0.1337690205987421,0.3685535460925178,0.2122460199487619,0.1787096362535532,0.2888636945806973,-0.4919454545454545,0.2261176470588236,0.1086582752130863,0.159613495100014,0.3059675103260731,0.4321470588235294,0.5354705882352941,0.5986176470588234,0.01052631578947368,0.0,0.02105263157894737,0.06315789473684211,0.03157894736842105,3,-26.666666666666668,False,Hilton

So I have some familiarity with how Hilton Hotels work.The Homewood Suites at Memorial City is a nice property, but I will never be staying there again after the way I was treated on this stay. I was running late and called to ask for assistance on the phone, and I encountered the most rude and unhelpful person I have ever talked to by phone at a Hilton Hotel. The end result is that she told me if I didn't get there to check in in person I was at risk for losing my room after midnight. After finally arriving I was happy to hear I still had a room but was greeted by a front desk person who was just as uncaring and unhelpful as the person on the phone, and she lied to me about the occupancy of the hotel on top of that.Overall a very disappointing stay. Even though it is a nice property, unless there is a complete overhaul of the management and staff, I would recommend staying as far away from this hotel as possible. There are a dozen Hilton brand hotels within a 15 minute drive of this hotel, and all of them treat you with more courtesy and respect than this place.

Had to reconnect and find the network every 10 minutes and no WiFi at all in the bedroom or kitchen. Very annoying especially since I booked a hotel with WiFi due to business.

I would add, our room while acceptable, was not really all that clean. If you looked along the sides of the bedside tables, there are heavy dust accumulations. And yes, the elevator near the lobby was out of service for a couple days, you could use the stairs if you didn't feel like walking to the back of the building to use the other hotel.The noise from the A/C unit in the 'living room' will keep you awake at night. (2nd floor room) Cabinetry in the rooms is very dated. Carpeting in living area is definitely showing wear. Honestly, I have never slept so badly, pillows were awful and we even requested replacements, which were slightly better. Noise from A/C (sometimes the airplanes), and uncomfortable bedding did not make for a restful stay.Breakfast for Thursday and Friday was really wonderful, breakfast this morning was 'sad'.I think we overpaid for the quality of this property (~150 per nite) but looking at the pricing now, it's well over that. This property shouldn't run MORE than the 150 and frankly should be less.Everything Metallica said about the staff was true - very nice, responsive, smiling at all times.We won't stay at this property again, either. :-(","Thank you for choosing the Homewood Suites for your stay in Miami.We appreciate you taking the time to share your review on this site and we lookforward to welcome you back.Kind regards,",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: November 2017,"Response from MMartinsGM, General Manager at Homewood Suites Miami-Airport West","Responded Oct 5, 2018",34,85.92,99.0,66.34,99.0,34.0,17.65,85.29,52.94,23.53,20.59,0.0,5.88,14.71,0.0,0.0,2.94,5.88,17.65,0.0,2.94,2.94,0.0,8.82,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.71,14.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26.47,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.88,5.88,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,14.71,11.76,0.0,0.0,2.94,0.0,0.0,8.82,0.0,17.65,2.94,14.71,5.88,2.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.82,5.88,2.94,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.4,0.826060606060606,1.477878787878788,1.534545454545454,309.2107224238928,600.1026409699285,4.92,3.22,7.72,0.09014285714285715,0.06656218796031657,0.2057280571417377,0.1026368435126636,0.0920361459237888,0.4052101031156575,-0.2321818181818182,0.2987058823529412,0.06821293408597885,0.1110912654959511,0.3617678485137478,0.4047777777777777,0.5975555555555556,0.7523333333333333,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0303030303030303,0.1515151515151515,5,-29.8,False,Hilton

We were told it would be ""5 more minutes"" when we arrived at check-in time, then were told 30 min later that it would be another hour. This was annoying (traveling all day with small children), and we weren't alone -- several other families were waiting with us in the lobby, due to the same issue. The staff was nice enough, but seemed untrained / unsure how to deal with us all.When we finally got to our room, there was still trash from the people before us.

Amer (I think I got the name right) and his staff gave us directions, got our car faster than I thought possible, and were generally amazing - without ever seeming to expect a tip.The bad - a lot else.We are diamond members. We got no welcome gift.My son and I came back the second day to find that our keys had been deactivated. Because the reservation was in my husband's name first, they made us contact him to allow us to get into the room. This despite the fact we had called in advance to make sure my name was also on the room. The manager was rude, and never apologized for us being locked out of our room. He was more concerned that I give him my old key to prove I had been in the hotel.Only one of the two elevators was in service during the time we were there. In an 18 story hotel this is a problem.The refrigerator in the room did not work (our lunch meat went bad).The toilet in the room kept running until we went back in and played with it.The staff I dealt with (other that the weekend manager) were great - but the elevator situation was a problem and they do not respond to customers when you call with requests.","Hello and thank you for your review!

Based on the reviews here, I expected a lot more.Firstly, the positives. You can't deny how great this location is- it's incredibly central, surrounded by great shopping and restaurants, and about 35 minutes from O'Hare if traffic is cooperating. The staff at the breakfast area are really lovely- friendly and helpful and patient with the hoards of people who descend on them every morning. My suite was spotlessly clean when I arrived and the rest of the property is well maintained as well.However, there are a few things I was not pleased to find. If you're expecting peace and quiet, this is not the place for you. Street noise, as well as noise from the hallway and your neighbors, is a near constant. There are also (understandably) a lot of families who stay here with small children, adding to the noise level.The AC in my room does nothing to control the humidity, leading to a stuffy, clammy atmosphere, even when it's running constantly. The linens and towels are not high quality- the hand towels literally disintegrate on your hands as you're drying them, leaving bits of fuzz and white fluff all over you. The free breakfast is basically a bunch of beige foods of varying quality- the fruit option this morning were blueberries that had clearly been thawed from frozen.Also, if you're expecting a welcome or thank you for being a Hilton Honors member with status, you won't find one here- I didn't even get a complimentary water bottle on check in. Overall, I had much higher expectations about the level of service and comfort at this property.","Hello and thank you for your review!

Friday through Sunday with plans to go to the Shedds aquarium and Millennium Park. . First thing that bothered me was the location of check in. Check in is located on the 6th floor with valet on the 1st floor only. While that might not seem so bad for some it was it was for our family considering the elevator ran soooooooo slow and squeaked all the way up to the 6th floor. At check in the young lady and elevator guy were nice considering I was scared of the elevators after seeing how tall the hotel was. Our rooms were not 1804 and 1801. The valet guys were awesome! They delivered our bags up and even helped put some of food away in the fridge. Breakfast was horrible each day. Watery eggs and cold saugage the first day. The second day was watery eggs with cold tator tots and sausage. The pool with a gym was located on the 19th floor. It was nice and clean. Customer service at night was very unprofessional. It was Saturday night coming from the pool with the kids when we noticed two teenagers with pizza boxes and pajamas on. So I was thinking there is some sort of restaurant or something in the building. So my husband and I went to the front desk to ask. When we arrived there was the front desk young lady and the security guard. I asked if there was a resturant in the building, the security guard rudely says ""People dont come down here at this hour asking questions. Use your phone"" The desk clerk just handed me a pizza list and sent us away. I wont be back.

Staff was not concerned if I wanted to extend or check out they simply SAY they had sold the room and I needed to vacate the room. Mind you I didn't get packed til 7pm.

Upon arriving, I was impressed with the room design and it was fairly updated. I left for the afternoon and upon arrival in the evening, I noticed a bug on the floor. It ended up being a roach. What ""bugged"" me what I left my suite case open on the countertop (room had a small kitchen area). I grabbed a paper towel and killed the roach.I called the front desk and asked if they had a roach problem. The man advised no and that he's never heard of any issues. The agent answering didn't bother transferring to a night manager and honestly it didn't seem to bother him much. I wasn't going to make a big deal out of this but upon waking in the morning, I went back into the kitchen area (suitcase still open) and what do I see? Another roach. This time it was coming out of the coffee machine. I was disgusting having a pack of open candy 5 inches from the machine. I went to kill in and it went inside the machine. I went to grab my phone to record this (as I did the night before as well) to show the managers. I called down to the main floor and they advised they would change my room.But I leave this hotel with a few thoughts. Unless roaches are common and expected, how the heck didn't a supervisor, manager or anyone acknowledge this? By this I mean call, email, or write a letter apologizing.

But they are clearly still trying to get it together a few months into business. I have filled out a couple of surveys and spoken to the staff nicely about my concerns. The front desk staff is nice, but they seem to have a lot of going on and don't seem to be able to multi-task or stop and focus on the guest. (I should add that I'm a frequent traveler for my job, and I'm a Hilton Honors Diamond member. No one at their front desk has ever thanked me for my loyalty as they do at most all other properties. This tells me it's probably a training issue.)I always have to wait on the valet... ALWAYS. (Maybe have more than one at this busy LAX property and help the poor employee out as well as provide better service???)The complimentary breakfast is consistently pretty bad. The fresh fruit is always like it's old. The bananas in the uncut basket this morning we're not even close to ripe and still had a lot of green on them. The scrambled eggs were barely warm and there's never any cheese or salsa or anything to even try to doctor them up. It is a very clean space though for sure. The attendant is right on it.The restaurant has a nice menu. Tonight my dinner was tasty, but the mashed potatoes were not warm. The chicken and the brussell sprouts were nice and hot, over top of room temp mashed potatoes. Hmmm... Not sure how that happens.Yesterday there was no wifi in the hotel, and today there is no cable. WTH??? The maid came in today as I got back from work tonight. I left the room at 6 am. Seriously!?!I'm over it. I really want to like this place as I waited months for it to open as construction progressed, but I don't think I will likely stay here again, especially with $44ish parking on top of everything else. It is certainly the nicest HHonors property in the airport area, but I'm truly so disappointed. It shares the building w/ the Curio Collection H Hotel, so it is a very, very nice property. I guess I have to ask, If a Hilton Diamond member experiences these things and is treated this way, was does the average traveler have to look forward to??? Sorry Homewood Suites LAX, I speak the truth.","JDM0225 - thank you for your time in posting comments about your recent stay with us, and we appreciate your loyalty as a Diamond member with Hilton Honors.

We split the family up into a group of 3 and 2. The rooms are very small (normal for NYC) and generally have a king size bed and a pull out. This is meant to be for up to 3 people. It was not big enough for me and we had requested 2 beds in each room but did not get them as apparently they only have a limited number of rooms with this layout. So our 2 person room was very uncomfortable.Breakfast was included and the food is not bad but there are simply not enough tables which means you are hanging around for a while waiting to grab a table, This is never too easy when there are 5 of you.They have 3 lifts - you'd think that was enough? You'd be wrong over the 4 days we were there we always squashed into a lift with at least 6 others. Not the end of the world but it was annoying and made it all feel too busy,All of that is negative.On the plus side the staff are very good and work very hard especially the breakfast crew who are constantly on the go cleaning the tables that people are waiting for. The hotel is clean and every request for extra towels was met quickly and efficiently. The location is very convenient for the subways and walking to Times Square is a no more than 10-15 minutes.If you are a family looking for a budget stay in NYC with no frills then this is better than most. In short a base to explore NYC from then this is fine. If you want a few more hotel 'type' facilities then don't book.So yes it was poor and only 2* for us but of our kids were younger - less than 10 then it would have been fine.",Thank you for choosing the Homewood Suites by Hilton! We would like to apologize for the inconvenience during breakfast. We also offer breakfast togo in those moments. Aside from that we hope you will give us the opportunity to make your next visit a fantastic one.Nicolas RambajueOperations Supervisor,Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: December 2017,"Response from Mark T, Manager at Homewood Suites by Hilton New York/Midtown Manhattan Times Square-South, NY","Responded Dec 25, 2017",49,91.15,99.0,1.69,99.0,12.25,26.53,83.67,48.98,18.37,14.29,0.0,8.16,6.12,0.0,0.0,4.08,8.16,16.33,4.08,2.04,2.04,0.0,14.29,4.08,0.0,0.0,2.04,0.0,10.2,10.2,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,22.45,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.16,2.04,2.04,4.08,2.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.08,14.29,8.16,2.04,4.08,2.04,0.0,0.0,8.16,4.08,10.2,2.04,2.04,6.12,2.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.16,6.12,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,2.04,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,23.2,1.394117647058823,1.888039215686274,2.009411764705882,308.2774558095682,584.4427373323638,5.85,3.66,8.16,0.059,0.2324117485669049,0.15457018600187,0.1315622759804893,0.2032707893964607,0.5311465844920839,-0.4095714285714285,0.4234444444444444,0.1267781430382007,0.1592851068472912,0.2552649369178455,0.4677058823529412,0.5716470588235295,0.7279411764705882,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0784313725490196,0.05882352941176471,7,19.428571428571427,True,Hilton

We were given a room on the first floor (103). The room itself seemed fine at first. We soon discovered the air conditioner in the bedroom sounded like a jet revving to take off whenever it was running, and earplugs were necessary to sleep. Earplugs were no help, however, for the cigarette smoke that came wafting into the room each night (the room was at sidewalk level next to a pub, whose patrons came outside to smoke. Though the windows were not openable, the smoke came in anyway). The hotel was booked solid and breakfast was crowded (though well stocked), but tables were hard to come by.","We appreciate you taking the time to express your concerns in regards to your recent stay at our hotel.

The coffee packets were poor, very poor, it didn't taste like coffee. Every hotel I've been to has had a fan in the bathroom, but not this one (?). The hotel does not have staff to escort you to your room or to transfer luggage. I've never stayed at a place that pre-charges your credit card in the event extra charges are required after you check-out. I was also charged another amount after I checked out. No response from hotel when I queried these charges and why. Typically, I agree to pay an amount, I check in and upon check out I am charged for my stay.

I am a very light sleeper and i do not think there is one room here that gets less than insane freeway noise. The doors do not seal to the hallways either, so expect to hear other guests talking and if you are near it you will hear the elevator. because of the unique shape, the hotel rooms are probably the smallest i have stayed in, with definitely the smallest bathrooms possible. Beds are very comfortable, some of the best i have used, without that i may have not slept at all, even with earplugs. I usually mask any noise in most hotels by running the bath fan and ac fan at full during the night but there was not a bath fan and the ac fan had a mind of its own and turned on and off throughout the night regardless of settings. The pool is nice but not warm in comparison to most and there is no hot tub. They have a nice small outdoor fireplace that is on in the evenings. the gym is small but looks over the pool and have quality treadmills and ellipticals.The restaurant/lounge on the top floor is a gem and reminds me of a vintage elite country club with a great view.I love the tip free atmosphere.the complimentary valet service is probably normally a nice touch, but record rains and below average temps during our visit made for uncomfortable waits(it would have been nice to just go get our own car when we wanted to).all in all, if you are a sound sleeper and only traveling by yourself or as a couple you will probably like this place, otherwise i suggest doing as i will and shop around further.","Hi,Thank you for your feedback.We apologize for the noise from the freeway.Due to our location we go above and beyond to eliminate any noise.We have double paned Windows to help with the noise, we understand if some guests are more sensitive to the noise and we can help by offering different rooms.You can set the A/C to run all night long, or you can set it to turn off after a certain temperature - our front desk is open 24/7 and happy to help guests with A/C settings.We offer complimentary daily Valet Parking to make our guest experience as pleasant as possible, but we'll review your feedback, as we understand and respect that not all customers have the same needs.We're sad to hear you won't be staying at Hotel Angeleno again, but I'm glad you enjoyed our restaurant.

Friendly, personable, and just a delight.The rest of the experience was a crap show.The bathroom door was broken and trapped me - embarrassing and frustrating. The windows are not designed for the city so you can hear EVERYTHING. It sounded like people were in our room, when they were talking outside. We were exhausted from moving across country and had specifically chosen to stay at this pineapple location,based off the amazing experience we had in Portland Oregon. These hotels were nothing alike.In addition to a broken bathroom and noisy environment, we could hear people in other rooms. We were woken up at 2am by loud blasting beeps, and no Explanation was given.In the morning, exhausted and worn out, we headed to the continental breakfast. Previously, Portland Oregon has provided an amazing breakfast with gluten free options. Here, in a city that certainly has similar, if not more gluten free focused eateries, we were greeted with the absolute saddest ‚Äúcontinental ‚Äú breakfast ever. There was cereal, pastries, a bowl of fruit, and a container of four hard boiled eggs, not being kept at any temp. When I asked the front desk if there were gluten free options they seemed extremely confused by the request and let me know there were hard boiled eggs and fruit..... that‚Äôs not breakfast, and for the room cost I would expect more.At checkout, no one made any effort to communicate or even ask us how our stay was. We were simply handed a receipt and told to have a good day. Really unfriendly morning staff.Overall, the location was an absolute disappointment. I will not stay here and will think twice before trying out other pineapple locations.","arielmelissaah,Thank you for sharing your feedback, I'm terribly sorry that your stay was not better.

This time not so much. I am getting angry just writing this review reliving the experience. Everybody at the front desk especially Mandy were very professional and pleasant and quick to recognize me as a Diamond Elite Member, which is always nice. I spend at least 200 days a year in hotels, so it matters. Now for the part that makes me angry. Upon check in I always inspect the beds, bedding and towels to make sure they are fresh. At this check in I did my normal routine, pulling back blankets to find several hairs from previous occupant and what is obvious wrinkles from previous person. I complained and it was made right, with a fresh sheet change. During a two week stay I ask for a full room service only on day 7, and leave my trash outside the door, get my own towel exchanges when needed etc. I should be a housekeeper's dream. I also mark the bottom sheet of my bedding to make sure the housekeepers are doing their job so I can calculate the size of their tip upon check out. Day 7 arrives, expecting a full service I leave for the day of work and arrive to what appears to be a fully cleaned room. Oh no, there it is, my little writing, on the bottom sheet. Look, don't try to pull the wool over my eyes. Housekeeping didn't do her job as she should have. There were still pieces of paper on the floor, stickiness on the bath counter, etc. Yes, the towels were changed, some air freshener sprayed in the room, and the bed straightened, but that was it.Of course I mentioned it to the front desk, who were apologetic enough and remedied the problem. The soap, conditioner and shampoo is is a dispenser on the wall in the bath, towels were thick and fluffy, bed was firm with several pillows of different firmness. Wall air/heat unit worked wonderfully. Breakfast was the typical fare, but the highlight is the cinnamon french toast. I nice change from waffles. Rooms in the back of the hotel are more quiet, and away from the smells of the restaurant that shares the parking lot. Parking can be limited on the weekends especially because they share the lot with that eating establishment. Internet was fast and reliable. They have a big advertisement bill board in the lobby for the restaurant and their guide t.v. channel advertises the place as well. A simple suggestion, they should work with the place and get the guest a discount.","Hello AngelaHansen84116, I am so glad to hear that you had a great experience at the front desk and I will make sure to pass along your message to Mandy! I am also currently working with our housekeeping team to make sure that what you experienced does not happen to you or to anybody else in the future. Please feel free to reach out to me if you have any additional information and/or concerns at Christine.Kim@hotelnexusseattle.com. Thank you and we look forward to seeing you in the future.

The service is inconsistent though. Our front desk check in lady was fantastic. So helpful and when she realised it was my birthday, sent a complimentary bottle of champagne to the room. The rooftop bar manager was also lovely and couldn't have been more helpful. Sadly, as we already had plans for my birthday evening we didn't have time to drink my champagne, so I left a note on it for the maid to say please don't take this as we want to drink it later. We came back from our day out and needless to say she had taken it. Also she never left us water in our room. Having spoken to the cleaning manager, she said she would sort it out and that should not have happened re the champagne. She sent us up some water with another guy, but no word about the champagne. Even if she said there was nothing she could do I would have been upset, but understood. To just do nothing and not respond though was poor and I think pretty rude.Beware re the taxi too. When we left we asked about taxis and a woman on the desk said she would get a price. In fact she went ahead and booked one. We said how much is it to JFK and she said $75 (plus we would be expected to tip). I said but it's a fixed fare if we get a yellow cab and she said it's not and that we would be on the meter, which would be more expensive. I knew that not to be true and sure enough, the yellow taxi fare is $53 fixed rate. So with the tip, we saved about $20. It's not the money, but having been to NYC many times I knew the fare was fixed. To mislead travellers (as I'm guessing there is a kick back to the reception staff for referring taxi rides to a company) is not good. It's such a shame as the staff that were good, were really good.","Thank you for sharing your feedback of your recent stay with us and glad to hear you enjoyed your birthday weekend with us as well as the complimentary drinks offered at our rooftop, cupcake platter and bottle of prosecco provided to you complimentary as well. Our team truly try to go above an beyond for our guests, especially those celebrating a special occasion. Our housekeeping team were addressed on the matter of the prosecco you think went missing from your room and a follow up should have been done that same evening, I believe our Director of Experience has been in contact with you regarding this.Our car service is a very convenient option for our guests as they are readily available. New York City's yellow cabs, licensed by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission, offer a flat rate service of $50-$70 from JFK airport to Manhattan as well as anywhere in Manhattan to JFK, excluding tips and tolls. Tips should be around 15-20% of the total price and are common for the good service. Our car service pricing includes the tip as well as the tolls-if you were asked to tip on top of this please inform us as this would not have been correct of the driver and also unusual.Again, we appreciate your feedback and very glad your birthday was a memorable one!Nalini SullivanGeneral Manager",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: July 2017,"Response from NaliniSullivan, General Manager at Hyatt Herald Square New York","Responded Jul 19, 2017",233,80.3,99.0,14.27,99.0,38.83,22.32,83.69,54.51,13.3,11.16,0.43,5.15,5.15,0.0,0.43,2.15,6.44,18.88,7.3,5.58,7.73,0.43,12.88,8.15,5.15,0.0,2.15,0.43,7.3,6.87,0.43,0.0,0.0,0.43,16.74,0.0,1.29,0.0,0.0,8.15,2.15,0.0,2.15,1.72,1.72,1.29,1.29,0.43,0.43,0.0,0.86,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.86,10.73,7.73,2.15,2.15,0.43,0.0,4.29,7.3,0.0,12.88,2.58,6.44,3.86,4.29,2.15,0.43,0.86,0.0,0.0,1.72,0,0.0,0.0,1.72,0.0,9.87,3.0,3.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.43,1.29,0.0,0.43,0.0,1.72,89.5,1.128825910931174,1.720202429149797,1.829676113360324,339.3819298290696,588.215828357479,4.154999999999999,2.755714285714285,7.255714285714286,0.06848706896551726,0.1762701347003955,0.2874346117339311,0.1375302176157572,0.2188097875229386,0.392651660403862,-0.3208761904761906,0.3904015748031496,0.2035121530036149,0.19179505073648,0.2860580809560154,0.4515125,0.548025,0.7079499999999996,0.004048582995951417,0.0,0.004048582995951417,0.04453441295546559,0.048582995951417,5,-24.2,False,Hyatt

That night, my daughter sat up in her bed. When I asked her what was wrong she mentioned that she saw a bug in her bed. When I went over to take a look, I noticed that it was a bed bug. I immediately went down to the front desk to request a new room. Once we made it to the new room it was clear that my daughter and my Wife were still uncomfortable being in the hotel. We ultimately decided to leave the hotel. I captured photos of the bed bug in the room and the front desk clerk told me that I would need to send the photos to the site manager before checking out In order to be considered for a refund. This all occurred around 1:15am and the front desk clerk said that there would be no one to issue a refund until 8am. We left for another hotel and I returned the next morning only to be told that they would have to conduct an investigation that would involve a pest control company and if bed bugs were found, they would issue a refund at that point. Obviously they did not find any bed bugs during their investigation. The fact is that I saw the bed bug myself and now they cannot find them. Based on the fact that the Hyatt Place Chicago Midway will not be honest about the presence of bed bugs in their hotel, I feel obligated to share my story in efforts to help all consumers make a better choice. There are several hotels that are much nicer and at comparable prices in the same area. I advise you to pick somewhere other than Hyatt Place Chicago Midway.","Thank you for your feedback. We have procedures to follow in these instances to verify authenticity of these kinds of accusations and to ensure that we properly handle any instances of bed bugs, were the claims validated. In this instance, you were being very evasive with the staff and refused to produce the evidence. When the staff did a thorough inspection of the room and nothing was found, we called in a major pest elimination company to inspect. They also found no evidence of any insects up to and including bed bugs. We have several procedures in place to keep pests from being found in our guest rooms. This claim was found to be less than genuine.",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: February 2016,"Response from HyattPlaceMDW, General Manager at Hyatt Place Chicago Midway Airport","Responded Feb 25, 2016",117,89.46,92.68,41.17,14.06,16.71,21.37,82.91,54.7,11.97,7.69,0.0,4.27,2.56,0.0,0.85,4.27,5.98,20.51,8.55,2.56,5.13,1.71,15.38,2.56,1.71,0.85,0.0,3.42,2.56,0.85,1.71,0.0,1.71,0.0,11.11,0.0,0.85,0.0,0.0,11.11,5.98,0.85,0.0,1.71,0.85,1.71,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.69,4.27,0.0,3.42,0.0,0.0,8.55,5.13,0.0,11.97,0.85,7.69,3.42,4.27,0.0,3.42,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.55,5.98,2.56,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,46.6,0.9425196850393701,1.456141732283465,1.411102362204724,317.0296709381282,577.0535588552652,3.075,2.525,5.445,-0.08481147540983607,0.1550160071878696,0.2517574085250562,0.2743663773724379,0.3043917259908571,0.274928793797518,-0.4068124999999998,0.2705000000000001,0.09013754582117611,0.187602566325542,0.3019353711238662,0.4417750000000001,0.563925,0.6201,0.0,0.0,0.007874015748031496,0.03937007874015748,0.02362204724409449,6,-30.0,False,Hyatt

That does not mean you will wait 35 minutes or less. Scheduled trips are once an hour during most times and the van they use is tiny so there may not accommodate you.

In general the staff were very friendly and helpful. But the hotel itself, even though it appears clean and new, was in need of some tlc. I think they need to replace the duvets in each room...if you hold them up to the window, you can see they are dirty inside. The bathrooms are quite tiny...a bit inconvenient to use. The pool was quite nice and seemed fairly well maintained; except it is not heated. There are no amenities near this hotel and it is a bit tricky at first to find (a U-turn is needed on the freeway). We were skeptical after reading the review about the cockroaches, but we never saw any and we were looking for them. There were a couple other bugs... The hotel was super noisy the one night with some very inconsiderate partyers on our floor, but not much the hotel can do about inconsiderate people.","Dear 4familytravels4fun, thank you very much for the feedback.

It will more closely resemble the breakfast at Hyatt's full service properties.I'm sorry to hear that key reader on the elevator proved to be an inconvenience, however that is installed for our guests safety and privacy. We want to ensure that only guests and our housekeeping team have access to our guest room floors.

Finally, upon checking out and receiving my bill, I was charged for some sort of unlimited liquor offer that I hadn't purchased.Overall, it feels like they take advantage of people who want to stay near the airport and are used to the Hyatt brand/quality.

Starting with the front desk service, Ryan was very rude and unhelpful. I had to switch rooms twice and the second room was placed near the alley where the city workers start collecting trash at 2a, which is right next to your window. Needless to say, it was not a good nights rest. When I called down to see if there was another room to switch to, I was told by Anthony that I could come down after 8a and see what they had available and I could blame the city. No blame, how about just switch rooms?? Stay somewhere else, perhaps a place with helpful staff!","Doxietraveler,Thank you for your feedback.

I was going to be passing through L.A. and booked one room for one night at the Lexen through Expedia. Unfortunately for me, I used the autofill to enter my info and ended up making a reservation for the day before I arrived. I noticed the error that same night and tried to change my reservation but they were completely booked for the night I was going to be in town. I called the Lexen directly but was unable to get a hold of someone. Expedia called on my behalf but they said the front desk staff said the issue would have to wait until the following morning when the manager arrived. When I arrived in L.A., (I ended up staying at the BLVD and highly recommend it!) I took the time to go personally to the Lexen but the front desk employee told me the same thing: it was a matter for a manager but she was not on the premises, so they asked me to return hours later. Long story short, I was never able to talk to a manager until days later over the phone (I had already left L.A.) and after my many attempts at talking to an administrator, I was told the policy of the hotel was simply NO refunds. I understand it was my mistake and the policy is clear on their website. My review has the purpose of warning those who are considering booking at this hotel in the future: THEIR BOTTOM LINE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR SATISFACTION. Despite the fact that the hotel doesn't seem to be wanting for business (they were completely booked), they had no interest in making any service recovery efforts, even for an honest mistake. I have dealt with businesses before where they happily refund money for services that were not provided, even if they have a policy of no refunds because they acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes and more importantly, they understand that in the service/hospitality industry customer retention through service recovery is essential. The management at Lexen was more interested in keeping my money, even one room for one night's worth, than in establishing a good reputation.","Sol,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.I apologize for the inconvenience and I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, we have certain policies set in place that we are required to uphold, including our strict 24-hour cancellation policy.We cannot adjust our policy for just one guest, while expecting to deliver the same, exceptional service to our other guests.

Easy and cheap commute be a Uber or Lyft. Room was okay. Air conditioning certainly annoying at night and seem to blow right into your face. Breakfast was not very good selection and opted to eat out every morning. Parking is definitely a problem in the evening unless you park on the street the hotel has a very limited parking spaces available and if it's full they expect the keys because you will have to park in front of another vehicle. Seemed also a little noisy in the evening coming from the courtyard as the bar is open late. Value to comfort was adequate. Probably would return if in the area again.,"Many thanks for your kind review posted recently and for taking the time to share your experience with us.

620,21,21.0,30.0,,,,,,,,,,,apology7,Lexen Hotel - North Hollywood,30,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during an 18 day tour around the west coast of the USA. This resulted in quite a few hotel experiences, some good, some not so.Staff : I would describe the reception staff at The Lexen as 'bored'. Often they were not at the desk and when traced were more often than not on their phones, either talking or typing. On arrival I asked for local info and received a very disinterested response so didn't try again. The cleaning staff do not speak any English so I would advise against asking them anything (not a criticism).The hotel is small as described. There are 4 floors. All rooms appear to look onto the central courtyard where the bar is located. The bar is hardly used (can it be justified?) however as it is open from 5pm until 11pm each night and as a result the music, which is played loudly, can be heard from your room. As can the glass bottles being cleared after the bar closed. I did ask if there was another room but told abruptly no (I got the impression this is a common question). The music from the bar being audible in your room when you want to sleep is the one and only reason I world not recommend this hotel. Why, if the bar is empty, can the music not be quieter? In fact, as it is a social area rather than a pub environment, why do all the room occupants have to listen to this every night (some of whom also have children). I can accept in some hotels outside noise is an issue, but can't really accept noise generated by the hotel design itself.The rooms : the room itself was absolutely fine. Two queen beds, comfortable. Good shower and bath. Safe, small fridge, iron and hairdryer. There is also a small coffee machine in bathroom.Breafast: there is a small breakfast room which each day did not have enough seats for the guests...and the max I saw there any morning was about 20. There are options of bananas, apples, porridge pots, bread and bagels and muffins. The is a coffee machine (available 24/7) which does cappuccino, latte, Americano etc nice touch). However, this is the only hot drink option at breakfast time so a queue develops (including housekeeping staff?) and the machine has to do a reheat cycle every so often which takes about 5 mins. Suggest some black coffee available separately for those who do not want a speciality coffee may help with queue. The coffee machine is located next to the only toaster in the corner of this room. As a result, this area is busy even with 5 people and is not really fit for purpose for a hotel with 40 rooms. Not much else I can say about breakfast, filled a gap.Gym:there is an air conditioned gym with 2 x treadmills, an elliptical trainer, a recumbent bike, a functional trainer, some very dirty yoga mats and a gym ball. There is a water machine and hand sanitiser but nothing to clean the equipment after use?? Suggest some sanitiser spray and wipes.Garage:as mentioned $10 dollars a night.Deposit :$250... Only hotel we stayed in that took such a large amount. Yet to see how long it takes to get it back.Location : North Hollywood (NoHo) seems a nice neighbourhood. There is a park across the road which is good if you jog (about 0.9 mile lap). There are homeless people in the park but we soon realised that is unfortunately the same all over the city. They gave me no hassle when I ran there. There is a 7-11 round the corner and plenty of places to eat. A lot are counter service. I would hight recommend Daves Hot Chicken on Lankershim - queues out the door says it all.The red line metro is nearby and will take you downtown. We took the metro to Hollywood Boulevard and also to Universal. ($1.75 single trip of $7 day pass) $2 to buy a TAP then load it at the station.To conclude my many thoughts on this hotel. It seems to me alot of thought went into the actual room design and theme of the hotel, but the practicality of the bar location being adjacent to rooms and the breakfast room let's it down, not to mention the general feeling the staff couldn't care less.As I type this I can hear the bar music and know I will not be sad to see when I leave this hotel.I had high hopes for the Lexen from the reviews (some of which I think are frauds looking at the one off reviews and user names), however it was a disappointment for me personally.","Thank you for taking the time to go into so much detail regarding your stay here; we are pleased that you had an enjoyable time, and the details that you have provided should be of great assistance to others thinking of visiting this area.

We have a simple goal of meeting and exceeding each of our guest's expectations when they choose to stay with us and we obviously failed this goal during your visit.I hope you can reach out to me personally so I can make proper amends as your awesome reviewer name does not give me enough information to find our more detail of contacting you.In addition, I wish I had more control of construction going on in my city, but unless it is happening on my property, we are unfortunately at the mercy of sometimes noisy activity in an amazing developing neighborhood.While I recognize that Moxy may not be the perfect brand for you, I would be happy to offer local knowledge of the 19 Marriott options located within eight miles of our hotel if you come back to Seattle soon.I hope to hear from you soon.Peace.Jerry StotlerCaptainjerry.stotler@moxyhotels.com",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: May 2018,"Response from Jerry S, General Manager at MOXY Seattle Downtown","Responded May 26, 2018",208,74.94,93.79,60.5,93.47,52.0,22.12,83.17,50.0,16.83,14.9,5.29,4.33,4.81,0.0,0.48,1.92,3.37,16.83,6.25,3.37,4.33,0.96,12.5,5.29,1.92,0.48,1.44,1.44,8.17,6.25,1.92,0.0,0.48,0.96,14.9,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.0,12.98,3.37,1.44,2.88,3.37,1.44,2.4,1.44,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.65,5.29,1.44,1.44,1.92,0.48,0.48,10.1,3.85,14.42,1.92,8.65,4.81,3.37,0.48,0.48,0.0,0.48,0.0,0.96,0,0.0,0.48,0.0,0.0,10.58,5.77,3.37,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.96,0.0,0.48,80.5,1.243066037735849,1.869905660377359,1.919198113207547,313.1259479622131,582.588016177306,4.818333333333332,2.823333333333333,5.318333333333332,-0.007738219895287957,0.1576185581324769,0.2839714941818034,0.1817633468916258,0.1968109499472576,0.327193735260125,-0.3528181818181818,0.3635978260869566,0.3020538410639079,0.1972569348676894,0.3681801465416467,0.4338243243243242,0.5691216216216216,0.677891891891892,0.04245283018867924,0.0,0.004716981132075472,0.04245283018867925,0.03773584905660378,3,9.666666666666666,True,Marriot

Thanks for taking the time to leave your feedback. I apologize that there was a wait at the front desk - the goal with having bartenders able to check guests in and front desk agents able to make drinks is to improve the operation by making roles more flexible. I apologize that this did not play out in your experience. The rooms at the Moxy are more compact than other Marriott brands but that does not excuse the flaws with your shower door and bathroom sink - we are having both of these issues addressed.Thank you so much for choosing the Moxy!

Picture late 60's boudoir mixed with 1920's french noir influence. There really ins't a lobby per-se. Just a small check in area and a cute, dark little bar to left.The hotel is literally right next door to the fabulous Peninsula and is located in the heart of Beverly Hills. Perhaps a 10 minute walk to Rodeo Drive. Starbucks, Teavana, and some other smaller cafes are a stone's throw from the hotel on Little Santa Monica Blvd.Please note, the hotel is a former apartment building. One of my main criticisms of the hotel is the musky, old smell throughout the building and in the room. A somewhat powerful smell and unfortunately not what you expect when staying at a luxury boutique hotel in Beverly Hills.The room itself was good. The decor was great (very Viceroy-ish). The bed was very comfortable and the A/C (while loud) was refreshingly cool! The bathroom had great style, although it is quite small. The shower pressure was good and the toiletries (Neil George) were great! I took a look at the Room Service menu and the prices were identical to the prices at the Peninsula. That didn't make sense since Maison 140 is nowhere as luxurious as the Peninsula.There was some wear and tear in the room that could have been easily repaired by management.Service was fine. Standard. Nothing expectional. Parking is $30. Standard for the area.Would I stay there again? Yes, only if the price was right and if the Peninsula was sold out.","Hello TravelLawyerOC,Thank you for your detailed review.

My options are limited since I have to travel on a government rate, but I probably wouldn't stay at this hotel again.The hotel bills itself as the former residence of the actress Lillian Gish. It has lost all semblance of a private residence, and feels rather more like a flop house... When I can I like to stay in smaller hotels, but this one has little charm. The place is really quite tired. My room was small but fine for one person (a ""Parisian"" room--it would have been very tight for 2)--the bathroom was tiny.As the hotel does not have central A/C, there are individual units mounted through the walls. Mine was a bit noisy and cycled on and off about every 60 seconds. If you're a light sleeper, this might be a problem for you. Having said that, I did not hear noise from the hallways or other rooms, so other guests did not bother me. I don't know how full the hotel was when I was there.My room looked out over a parking lot in the back--not sure what the rooms on the opposite side look out on.The service was quite friendly at check-in and check-out, and when I had some questions about the neighborhood the woman at the desk was cheerfully helpful. The location is not quite in the center of the Beverly Hills scene, but still convenient--maybe a 10-minute walk to Rodeo Drive.Overall, given the location this is a good value for the money, but it's definitely no-frills, and next time I'm in town I'll probably look for one of the larger hotel chains that will take my business rate.","TripsPlease, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us.

The hotel is super clean but there is an overwhelming ‚Äòmusty‚Äô smell on arrival - like the carpets need a good cleaning. When you get used to this and the ‚Äòold world‚Äô charm of the place it is actually a nice hotel. Breakfast is a bonus with lots of coffee on hand. It takes about 15 mins in a cab to get Downtown from here but easy enough and cheap in an Uber.,"Dear Guest,Thank you for your honest feedback.

We chose this hotel due to the proximity to a tour company we had booked with. The front desk staff were very friendly. They gave us a great upgraded room as we were staying on a first responder discounted rate, as well as great recommendations for things that were open close by. The location was great. Super close to a supermarket, bars, restaurants, and the Space Needle.The room was a bit old and outdated, but it's a older hotel. It appears to be an apartment building that was converted into a hotel. We had plenty of room though, which was nice. We were also up on the third floor so it was quiet and away from the street traffic a bit.Our biggest complaint was an experience we had with the valet. At certain times, he would seem to disappear for quite a while, which is slightly inconvenient if you want to get your car to make it somewhere on time. At one point, we waited for about 15 minutes. Finally the front desk agent said she would go get our car because we were trying to make it to a dinner reservation. She covered for the valet saying he was doing something else.It turned out that something else he was doing was smoking pot. He had the keys to our car so the front desk agent couldn't get it. When he finally pulled around in our car, he got out and wreaked of pot. And our car smelled of it as well since he had driven it-likely right after smoking. We didn't super appreciate that to say the least.","Dear Morgan M,Thank you for taking the time to share your thorough feedback regarding your stay with us. I'm certainly shocked to hear about your experience with our bellman/valet team member. That is not acceptable and I will investigate that immediately. I apologize for not seeing your review sooner.

It's an old historic building and whilst it has been refurbished they have chosen to retain some tatty features. Saying that it's spotlessly clean but this place is not to everybody's taste for sure. Please note that there is NO ELEVATOR in this building. Air conditioning is an issue and even in October I was unable to stay cool during the night. The view from my window was of a wall just four feet away and of the pigeon droppings on the ventilation system. The whole place is a little dingy in my view.,"Thank you for leaving a review of your stay. It is important as we will use your feedback to help us improve for the future.

I've stayed in a variety of hotels over the past 20 years but this one was a bit disappointing.The best feature was by far the central location. Very convenient both to Boston and the airport. It was very easy for the Uber drivers to find too.The public spaces are very nice so no complaints here. The two small elevators are in a very cramped location (due to the design of the historic tower I realize) but make it very crowded at times.The room was spacious enough but of very low to mid range furnishings and mediocre design. The lighting in the bathroom was extremely bright with no option to dim.The price I paid was comparable to the Kimpton brand of hotels and I would have to give the nod to them over this.,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and leave a review.

There is coffee available in the lobby, but no tea for tea drinkers. In the room it was possible to brew coffee and tea. The business center is off the front lobby and seems to be well arranged for many users. Seattle is expensive, but the price relative to the city seems to be good. We would consider coming back to this hotel if returning to Seattle.","Thanks so much for staying with us, UpstateExplorer.

The hotel room was discounted to $97 using the Groupon + energy/utility surcharge $2.80 + tourism tax $2 + sales tax $8.60 + hotel tax $6.99 = $117.39, which included wifi and gated parking. In high season, this room would easily go for two or three times the amount I paid -- Seattle no longer enjoys the sensibly priced hotel rooms it used to even as recently as ten years ago.The building is older but the hotel itself has been renovated. My room was very standard, approaching basic, but it was very clean, quiet and comfortable. It had a mini-fridge, microwave, coffee maker (coffee, tea, popcorn provided), tv, clock radio, hair dryer and the usual assortment of soaps and lotions. My room had an iron, ironing board, a valuables safe large enough for a big laptop, and an electric heater/air conditioner.The only downside was the bathroom's unbelievably powerful bathroom exhaust vent. It sounded 24/7 like a jet plane was preparing to take off as air was sucked out the vent, which also made the bathroom so cold it might have been possible to freeze one's derriere to the porcelain! I quickly found a piece of paper and held it up to the grille of the exhaust vent and the vacuum action sucked the paper so tightly to the grille that the paper didn't move all weekend! With the bathroom door left open and the exhaust vent restricted, the bathroom warmed up enough to be comfortable.Off the main floor foyer, complimentary coffee was available, as well as an exercise room, a computer/meeting room, and a Starbucks store also adjoined the lobby. The rooftop observation deck afforded city views and the hotel's Lower Queen Anne location had several restaurant options nearby. Downtown was a good long safe walk or a short bus ride away. Bikes were also available for a reasonable rental fee.All-in-all, combined with friendly staff and a discounted room rate, my stay was very enjoyable and I would gladly stay there again at the $117 all-in price.","Hello GadgetBC,Thank you very much for choosing to stay with us, and for providing us with your feedback about your time. I'm glad you were able to get such a great deal with our recent Groupon promotion! It's true that the demand in Seattle has made those lower prices hard to come by. Too many people have realized Seattle is such a great place to visit! I can confidently say that we always shop our competitors to stay affordable, but ""affordable"" in July is just nowhere near ""affordable"" in December or January.We were purpose-built from the ground up back in 2001, and regularly ""shop"" around our competitors to see what needs to change, while staying simple and comfortable. I hope you found everything you needed in the room!I'm very sorry you were as irritated as you were by the ventilation system in the bathroom. The machinery on the roof essentially pulls air up to ventilate the bathrooms, and on floors 2-6 it can't be controlled. I imagine (though I'm not certain) you were on the sixth floor. Not everyone is bothered by the white noise, and I wish we had known to have offered you a room on a lower floor. If you stay with us again, please mention this so that we can make sure you're comfortable!Again, thank you so much for your patronage and feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed your time in Seattle, and we would love to host you again.Best Regards,Kelsey AsplundFront Office Manager",Trip type: Traveled solo,Date of stay: February 2015,"Response from Mediterranean-Sea206, Front Office Manager at Mediterranean Inn","Responded Feb 6, 2015",255,51.59,97.01,68.68,95.55,23.18,17.65,92.55,56.86,18.04,14.12,3.14,4.31,6.67,0.0,0.0,3.92,5.49,15.29,8.63,6.67,6.27,1.57,16.08,7.84,2.35,0.39,1.57,1.57,8.63,6.67,1.96,0.39,0.39,1.18,15.29,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,11.76,1.96,1.96,2.35,1.18,3.14,2.75,1.96,0.78,0.78,0.39,0.39,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,12.16,5.49,2.75,4.31,2.35,0.0,4.31,10.98,0.78,18.43,3.14,12.16,5.1,2.75,1.57,1.57,2.35,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,16.47,3.92,4.31,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.57,0.78,2.35,2.75,0.78,0.0,97.3,0.854636678200692,1.382318339100346,1.416435986159169,328.7199885597656,595.084340712276,4.850666666666666,2.588,6.126666666666667,0.00984705882352939,0.1377486346632022,0.272847558288179,0.1673569468417993,0.2100282402959262,0.3519171732824203,-0.2694656488549619,0.3049274193548387,0.2163762513521059,0.1470338841012517,0.2544515824268908,0.4199125,0.544425,0.6652499999999999,0.02768166089965398,0.0,0.0,0.03460207612456748,0.05882352941176471,7,16.857142857142858,True,Unaffiliated

There is a fee for parking and sometimes finding a spot can be a challenge. The parking lot is shared with a Residence Inn and Courtyard.Check-in was easy and quick. The lobby offers nice seating and a bar right next to the check-in. The concierge lounge is off the lobby and offered a good selection of food and drink.This was my first time experiencing the newly renovated rooms. Modern upgraded bathroom with a nice move from carpet to ""wood"" floors. Very large flat screen TV with plenty of space to work. My only complaint and for me it is a big one is that I had a connecting room which meant that I heard very clearly the person in the next room. I heard them on the phone or when they were in the shower. It was almost as if there was no door or sound barrier between the rooms. This may be because of the doors used or it may be due to the uncarpeted floors allowing sound to carry. I would highly recommend asking for a non-connecting room unless you enjoy hearing your neighbor.There is an on-site restaurant which I did not use as well as a nice shop where you can buy ""to-go"" items if you want to go back to your room to work. The selection was good and the food was not bad.A good hotel that could be great if the sound issue is fixed between connecting rooms. Convenient location to Miami airport with free shuttle. Friendly staff and reasonably priced for Miami. Parking is not free and can be challenging to find a spot if the hotel and surrounding hotels are busy.","Thank you Fritz454, for being such a loyal guest to the brand and our hotel.

You are right there.This is an aging hotel that was given a slapdash face lift some years ago that didn‚Äôt really alter its basic nature very much. The rooms have a fresh coat of paint, they are clean and the beds and bedding are of reasonable quality. The bathroom provides the basics but nothing more.But sloppy management is evident everywhere beginning with the front desk. The people at the front desk should be given a lesson in courtesy and simple friendliness. The receptionist was perfunctory at best and gave us the impression that we were seriously interrupting her day.As indicated above the room‚Äînumber 600 to be specific‚Äîcontained a good bed, TV and a reasonable though very small bathroom. The rug was the cheap outdoor type carpeting but clean. There was a good chair--the best piece of furniture in the room‚Äîin one corner with a good reading light. However, it was downhill from there. The linoleum floor covering in the entrance area was chipped and poorly laid. There was a reasonable quality desk chair but there was no desk. Instead there was a low table like affair where the coffee maker and accoutrements were placed. There was no.light however in this area so you were working in the dark. Moreover, there was only one reading lamp that served the right side of the bed. The other side was simply without. The result was that you had half a room that was dark.

Turns out it was anything but. We walked for over 1/2 hour inside the terminal to get to the hotel from our gate. It would have been easier to get a cab to a local hotel. Staff in the airport didn‚Äôt even know where it was located! The gentleman checking us in did so while on the phone with someone and was only interested in getting my credit card number. That was a first for me. He was also less than helpful when I returned later to ask directions. The rooms are extremely dated, dark, gloomy, and small. Cleanliness was ok. I usually find that airport hotels are generally kept up to date. This was the worst I‚Äôve stayed in. My guess is that this hotel is busy by default and they have no incentive to upgrade. Next time I‚Äôll just head straight for a cab and go somewhere that I can at least get some fresh air and sunshine on my layover.","Dear IvBeenThere,Thank you for taking the time to leave us this feedback.

It is clear that no refurbishment work has been done on these rooms at all. The rooms themselves are roomy and the beds are relatively comfy however the layout of the room is horrific.In our room we had a large concrete pillar blocking our access to one side of the bed.

My wife finally banged on the wall and the noise level decreased, somewhat. This was after two calls to the main desk requesting assistance. Strange it would seem to take this level of action to resolve a problem such as this. We drove a long way and paid a lot of money for this romantic weekend. If I wanted this kind of aggravation I would have stayed at on of the plush hotels at Copley Square. If reasonable quiet was what you are seeking, so far, this is not the place.","We have contacted this guest and apologized for the inconvenience and lack of follow through by the front desk.

When we checked in, there was an issue with the room, and we had to move to a different room, as the beds were not what we requested.

My card wasn‚Äôt going through for incidentals which was very strange, so I called my bank and they said that it was not an issue on their end and that the hotel may need to try a different card reader or manually type it in. The guy at the front desk said he can only manually enter a card if his gets permission from his manager, so I asked if he could speak to his manager. I saw him pick up the phone and send out a text. He then said his manager said, no. I‚Äôve never seen someone act so dismissive in the hospitality industry.While the room is nice, the attitude is enough for me to make sure I look elsewhere next time.","Dear Cory, I apologized that your card declined after multiple attempts for incidentals at check in. It could be the chip on the card not functioning well as explained to you. As of the security policy it is required for the card to be recorded on the machine as swiped. To protect our guest and the hotel we are unable to put the card number manually. You were offered an option to put down cash or a different card which you did eventually and the different card worked.

Every few seconds there would be a loud thump against the walls and yelling. This went on from 11 pm to 2 am. It was very hard to sleep. I even had a dream that gymnastic students were next door. The cars passing by on the street can be heard too, it's an extremely busy street. Even with earplugs I could hear it.The next morning these crazy people were up at 8 am making noise again. We had a very poor nights sleep and were so relieved we'd switched from 2 nights to only 1 before we arrived. I don't think I could handle another.When I went to check out at 11:05 am at checkout time there was no one in the office. I rang the bell and waited and waited. No one was there. I left my card there. I never got a receipt so I was a little ticked off.I mean it's clean and it's not too far from the beach. But it's a little hard to enjoy a motel stay if you can't sleep. I always bring ear plugs but that didn't drown out the thumping and the cars. I don't even know if there was anyone at the front desk nor did I feel like anything would be done to quiet rowdy guests at a motel.It's not the worst place, but it wouldn't be my pick next time I go to Santa Monica. I'll spring for the extra to get a hotel without paper thin walls.",We are very sorry that you had a bad experience that night. As far as the traffic noise we are installing a triple glass windows in three weeks and hoping to solve that problem. We always have someone on front desk at all time.

Shower water pressure was all over the place and so with it the temp. Needed to constantly make adjustments to keep from freezing or burning. Valet was OK but the whole situation is odd and overpriced. For the cost of a room there's no excuse for gouging on parking especially when you add up all the other resort fees and ridiculous CA taxes. Nickel and dimed to death.

I understand that you found the heating in the room to be too warm but a simple call to the front desk and we would have been more than happy to have taken care of this for you. We are working on installing brand new air conditioning and heating units so hopefully this will help if you decide to give us another try in the future. And yes we do have bottled water in the minibar for purchase but of course if any of our guests are experiencing an issue such as you had; we will certainly do everything possible to remedy the situation without an added expense. We do have a wonderful ocean breeze here in Santa Monica, and that can leave a scent that some adore and some may not, which is why we have the option of an atomizer in the room, I am sorry that yours did not seem to work but again a quick call to alert our helpful and friendly staff and we would replace that right away as we have plenty of extra on hand.We do have some adjoining rooms with connecting doors and those doors are locked at all times and can only be opened by a front desk agent with a key, no guest can ever open those doors, I understand your concern with this but I can assure you they are completely safe and secure.And I am glad you received our wonderful welcome note that lets guests know about some of the wonderful features and amenities that we provide here at Palihouse and as you mentioned we do have some idiosyncrasies, being a historical landmark building we feel as most of our guests do that it only adds to the charm, it in no way indicates that we are here to give anything less than the best service possible when a guest calls the desk for assistance. I am really sorry to hear that you did not reach out to us with these concerns during your stay and allowed us the opportunity to address these issues for you to assure you had a wonderful experience, that being said I hope I was able to address your concerns and I do hope you will consider giving us another try if decide to visit beautiful Santa Monica again.Best,Greg Shortt | Housemaster",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: January 2017,"Response from PalihouseManagement, General Manager at Palihouse Santa Monica","Responded Feb 22, 2017",420,44.59,96.27,18.92,99.0,70.0,14.29,89.76,60.0,18.57,12.38,2.38,5.48,4.29,0.0,0.24,6.19,6.19,13.33,11.19,4.29,6.67,1.67,16.9,6.67,2.86,0.71,0.0,3.81,7.62,6.67,0.71,0.0,0.0,0.71,15.71,0.0,1.67,0.0,0.0,12.38,2.14,0.48,1.9,5.0,1.67,3.57,2.62,0.24,0.71,0.71,0.48,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.24,10.95,6.67,2.14,1.43,1.67,0.95,2.62,13.57,1.9,9.52,1.19,6.19,2.62,2.62,0.0,1.9,0.48,0.0,0.0,0.24,0,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,5.0,1.9,2.62,0.0,0.24,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.24,162.8,1.112827586206896,1.780689655172414,1.834873563218391,317.0988710640344,593.8242446463717,5.0495,2.6535,6.8755,-0.01752912621359224,0.1587496116673696,0.188734658592677,0.1508058787461482,0.1813663564555298,0.4964086237319616,-0.3452466960352423,0.3845891891891893,0.1325890244638475,0.1975786858932241,0.279626870095484,0.4267517241379308,0.5738413793103447,0.6932758620689656,0.02298850574712644,0.0,0.002298850574712644,0.05057471264367816,0.04137931034482759,4,16.25,True,Unaffiliated

I am happy to hear that you had a nice stay, however I am disappointed to hear about your concerns regarding the breakfast and restaurant options as we have a full restaurant in the hotel which serves breakfast and lunch in the lobby and both outside courtyards. We also offer Dinner service from 1212 restaurant in Santa Monica. Additionally we offer our hotel guests a free continental breakfast served in the lobby on Saturdays and Sundays, which our guests just love and of course room service, so we do have a lot of dining options. I am sorry for the confusion or if this was not explained to you properly when you were here staying with us. We would love to welcome you back and have you try some of our delicious local produce by Paligroup Executive Chef, Kris Tominaga.Best,Greg Shortt | Housemaster",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: July 2017,"Response from PalihouseManagement, General Manager at Palihouse Santa Monica","Responded Aug 4, 2017",155,61.74,99.0,12.83,97.29,25.83,21.29,85.16,52.9,15.48,12.9,1.94,5.81,5.16,0.0,0.0,2.58,5.81,14.19,7.1,5.16,8.39,0.65,11.61,4.52,1.29,1.94,0.65,1.94,7.74,6.45,1.29,0.0,0.0,1.29,18.06,0.0,1.94,0.0,0.0,8.39,0.65,0.65,1.29,5.16,0.0,2.58,1.94,0.0,1.29,0.0,7.74,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.45,10.32,8.39,1.29,1.29,0.65,0.0,2.58,7.74,0.0,10.32,1.29,8.39,2.58,3.87,3.23,0.65,0.65,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,8.39,3.87,3.87,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.65,61.4,1.117771084337349,1.638975903614458,1.739156626506025,337.2131219050891,580.4786461512123,6.35,3.065714285714285,6.577142857142857,0.08846052631578949,0.1628508967484094,0.2653228943787854,0.1630304579076745,0.127251845631673,0.3864178736472944,-0.2995223880597015,0.3942823529411765,0.1557838975443002,0.193497038285325,0.2438314599795756,0.4273962264150944,0.5227924528301886,0.7230188679245281,0.01807228915662651,0.0,0.0,0.05421686746987952,0.04819277108433735,9,15.777777777777779,True,Unaffiliated

I called the front desk around midnight and they lied, telling me that the music would be shutting down in the next half hour. The light over the bed wasn't working and the room was dim. The clock/radio was unplugged and I soon found out why--none of the controls worked. The attendant at the elevator was surly and unhelpful.

When we arrived the weather was hot and the apartment windows were all open so we didn't notice that the gas cooker was leaking gas into the apartment. We arrived durning the day and head straight out, when we got back at night we used the cooker to make tea, just before we went to sleep we thought we smelt gas but not to sure if we had turn the cooker off correctly and the windows were all open. During that night my sister sleeping outside on the pull out bed was coughing all night, the next day when the cleaner lady came in we asked if they could smell gas and she could get it straight away. We rang down to reception and they sent someone up straight away to fix the cooker and it turn out that the connection was fitted incorrectly and there was gas leaking. The staff in the hotel was so rude didn't offer us new room as they were fully booked up but when we rang our rep from our package company they rang the hotel and suddenly a room was available but didn't fit us all. The hotel did not apologise once to us and they just said it was our fault for not reporting it sooner.

684,-10,3.0,30.0,,,,,,,,,,,apologyOverallIdsaythis,Radio City Apartments,30,"Overall, I'd say this hotel is average to above average. I will say that I'm stunned that so many reviewers before me gave it 5 out of 5.It's been a while (decades) since I last drove into Manhattan, so I was a little nervous about getting to the hotel, unloading bags, parking, etc. When we pulled up, there were about 2-3 spots right out front, which surprised me. It gave my mother (the person who booked the trip) a chance to run in and talk to the front desk attendant, and I didn't have to stress about being double-parked. That was a bonus.The hotel works in conjunction with two local garages to offer discounted parking for guests, which is helpful. Still expensive to park for 1-2 days (it's Manhattan, after all), but it's not of control. It cost $70 (total) for 2 days in the Rockefeller Center parking garage, which is a relatively short walk from the hotel.We had originally booked what I believe was a 2-bedroom suite (or something along those lines). There was an issue that prohibited them from giving us that type of room when we arrived, so they offered two separate rooms for the same price, which we took. We had to wait a little bit to get in (We walked around a little), but they did have us in before regular check-in time, which was appreciated.We were initially given 1208 and 1211. Only 1208 was ready. OMG. In my opinion, and I'm not over-the-top picky, this room was small and dated. We were stunned, and not in a good way, because this room looked nothing like the pics we had seen online. Wow. The door for 1211 was open as well, and although it appeared to be a bigger room, it was still not what we were expecting. All of this was addressed at the front desk, and they did offer to move us to 704 and 706. Again, this was appreciated, and the difference between these rooms and 1208/1211, was very noticeable. The rooms on the 7th floor (the ones we saw), were way more up-to-date, including the kitchen areas.The beds were comfortable, and the rooms were relatively clean. No issues to speak of on that front. It was weird because, while it was obvious that money had been spent to upgrade the kitchen and bath areas, the bedding, walls, phones, etc., are in need of a serious upgrade. The thermostat situation was odd as well, mainly because there isn't one to be found. I spent 15 minutes looking for a thermostat in 704, and finally gave up. I opened the window to get some fresh air. There was a window unit (AC) in 1208, but not in either of the 7th floor rooms.It's a minor thing, but elevators are extremely tiny. Barely enough room for one luggage cart and 1-2 adults. They're slow too, and I ended up walking up and down the stairs on multiple occasions, rather than wait.The best thing this hotel offers is its location. I mean, it's a 10+. If you make a right and walk 2/3 of a block, you're at Rockefeller Center/Magnolia Bakery/Radio City. If you make a left and walk 1/3 of a block, you're in the heart of Times Square. It's tough to beat the location. The rest of my group went to a show at Winter Garden Theatre, and it's a 3-minute walk, at least to the 7th Avenue side.Check in/check out seemed to go smoothly, but I wasn't as involved in those processes.If I could give it a 3.5, I would, but I can't, so 3 it is. If you want something relatively clean and comfortable, and close to most touristy things in midtown, it's a good option. You do pay for that proximity (again, it's Manhattan). My advice to the hotel: please update your linens, bedding, etc. Spruce those rooms up a little.",Thank you so very much for letting us know about your stay by reviewing us.

It was finally discovered that the A.C. unit was not working. We had to change rooms, however, the engineer lied to us about this a/c unit being the best one in the hotel. Also, we had requested a scheduled wake up call that was never granted, I eneded up being late for an important meeting. Another issue was the breakfast, the food was mediocre at best and the staff that worked at the breakfast time slot were unfriendly and unprofessional. Moreover, we had to pay for our luggage to be taken by the bellhop person because we had checked out right after having them keep our luggage for a few hours. In the main lobby, upon checking in we could not use the hotel and the chess board pieces were missing 2 vital pieces to play a chess game.After having our room changed, the air conditioner we had in the new room was blowing out moldy/germy air that made my partner and I cough the entire stay at this hotel. Lastly, the walls are paper thin. We were able to hear one side of the room people having sex and the other side were people yelling/fighting with each other, this was around 3 a.m. on both nights. I strongly warn anyone of staying in this hotel because you are guaranteed to have a hellish of a time.P.S. The wifi has incessant amounts of intermittent connection. If you are able to get stable wifi in this hotel then it's because you're not using theirs and you're using your phone's internet.","Dear Abond001,We want to extend our sincerest apologies concerning all the issues that you have faced during your stay.

Do they keep your jewelry and never give it back? Well, when I called a few days prior to my stay about their pet policy, the woman at the desk told me all I need to know is that it is a $100 deposit for a pet. I come to find out when I check in that it is a $100 non-refundable pet cleaning fee. And I cannot stay higher than on the 2nd floor. So I call corporate and they say well I am sorry you don't like the terminology but that it how our policy is. So when I could hear the lobby noise loud and clear, I was annoyed I was not told about these two points before my booking. I am not so thrilled with this.

In the hospitality industry, this is commonly referred to as a pet deposit and we regret if you were not aware of this; on our website, this fee is listed as non-refundable. In order to welcome pet travelers, we must follow strict codes set forth by our local health department regarding sanitation and room location to protect other guests that may be allergic to pets.

The hotel is a short walk from two T stops and is in a great area especially for Boston's growing restaurant scene. The check-in process was easy and pleasant. The first room we were given was on the second floor. It was a king suite, which was a very large, well-appointed room and sitting area. Soon after, we were greeted with the noise of the guests in the room next to ours having a conversation that felt as though they were sitting in our room. We thought it was just a fluke and maybe we had some very loud talkers so we called down to the front desk. We explained the situation and they gladly moved us to the 3rd floor. We once again were very pleased with the room. After coming back from dinner and the concert, we proceeded to hear the couple in the room next to ours for hours. Needless to say, we did not sleep well. While I would love to recommend this hotel with its lovely location, decor, cleanliness, and staff...if you are looking for a good night's rest and you happen to have people next door to your room you will not have a good night's sleep.","We appreciate your comments regarding the great staff service you received, cleanliness of the hotel and our neat decor.We were disappointed, however, to hear of the challenges you experienced with noise from adjacent guest rooms - based on your comments we are looking into the matter and will do our very best to ensure that no guests experience the same challenge in the future.We thank you for having chosen our Residence Inn and do hope you will give us another try when in the Boston area again.",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: January 2015,"Response from Steven B, General Manager at Residence Inn Boston Downtown/Seaport","Responded Feb 13, 2015",88,64.08,99.0,7.84,99.0,88.0,19.32,92.05,56.82,18.18,15.91,0.0,9.09,6.82,0.0,0.0,2.27,7.95,13.64,7.95,4.55,5.68,1.14,15.91,4.55,2.27,1.14,0.0,1.14,10.23,9.09,1.14,0.0,0.0,1.14,23.86,0.0,2.27,0.0,0.0,5.68,1.14,1.14,1.14,2.27,0.0,1.14,5.68,1.14,2.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.91,9.09,4.55,2.27,2.27,0.0,1.14,9.09,4.55,11.36,1.14,6.82,4.55,4.55,2.27,2.27,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.95,3.41,3.41,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.14,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,35.7,1.175494505494506,1.830549450549451,1.864725274725275,320.9746564315475,589.6444013211548,4.614000000000001,3.082,6.358000000000001,0.03842352941176473,0.1628677648306232,0.2660160735540741,0.1721494059598948,0.2611046244199703,0.3839912756058949,-0.4017647058823528,0.3318823529411764,0.2290953027165345,0.1656733740474375,0.312237147512597,0.442375,0.59334375,0.6882187499999999,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.06593406593406594,0.06593406593406594,4,-17.5,False,Marriot

An old brick warehouse modernized but leaving a lot of the old elements. Rooms are huge with a separate living room and bedroom (but open to each other , no separate wall). Staff for the most part was great and you get a free breakfast. Now the bad, while the hotel is beautiful, some basic building aspects appear to have been skimped on. Our room was on the top floor (6th) and faced an alley. So no view but more important even though we were on the top floor we could clearly hear all the garbage trucks picking up , it was like we were right there with them. In addition there appears to be little or no insulation between the ceiling and the roof as we could hear sea gulls walking across every day. Be aware the location is a long way away from all the downtown sites, so prepare for a long walk. Speaking of, one day we had a food tour and walked many miles in 90 degree heat only to arrive back at the hotel in late afternoon to find our rooms had not been cleaned. I had to search the halls for a cleaning staff member to give us some fresh towels, Said staff member was friendly but spoke not one word of English so even though I told her we were going to take a nap, 1/2 hour later she was knocking on our door to clean it, at 5:30PM? And that free breakfast, basic at best so you get what you pay for. All in all a nice place if you have business in the Seaport area otherwise much nicer hotels closer to the action.","While we appreciate the compliments to our property and staff, it‚Äôs disappointing to read that we didn‚Äôt manage to exceed expectations throughout your stay with us.

Perhaps one of the best details was the clock that had usb jacks. All of our devices could charge simultaneously, also a rarity in many hotels.The downside on the hotel unfortunately was the service. Everyone was pleasant but we had two unfulfilled requests. We had requested a fan in the room at check-in and it was never brought up. We also had a problem with the shower draining properly and that also was not fixed. Nothing nastier than standing in 7"" or dirty water because no one properly maintains the plumbing.Also, the 10am breakfast closing is a hard closing time so beware and don't oversleep.

704,21,24.0,30.0,30.0,21.0,,,,,,,,,apologyWehadpreviouslystay,Residence Inn New York Manhattan/Central Park,10,"We had previously stayed at the Residence Inn by Marriott back in January 2015 for 3 weeks. Our experience in 2015 was outstanding and we had fond memories associated with staying there, so when planning our next trip to New York City for December 2016 we didn't have to think twice on where to stay. Our fond memories and feelings of this accomodation fell well short of everything we imagined it could be. It is safe to say that all our troubles began the moment we checked in with hostile and unfriendly staff at the desk, not even bothering to glance up at us to warmly welcome us. Our room was not ready for a 'couple of hours', it was a little after 1pm at this point in time. By the time we arrived later at 5pm our room was finally ready! My partner and I had requested a specific room type that was booked online according to images and description, obviously costing a lot more than the standard room. We did not receive a room that matched the description or photos that they included on their website. When this was communicated to an employee I said that this is considered false and deceptive advertising and he agreed! We communicated this to other staff at the desk but the issues we were experiencing went unresolved. We spoke with the reservation team on the phone at least twice and also approached reception twice. We were given the repeated line that the hotel's itinerary was undergoing an update because we had checked availability of the room we sought (and not received) and found several vacancies. This ultimately left us upset and confused that the room we had paid for was still available but we had not been given it. After also having contact with the 'manager' who was unhelpful and did not seem to understand our issues we finally went downstairs again for a third visit to a staff member in person. It took this many times to finally get our issue resolved, this staff member was the only employee to treat us with the upmost respect and kindness to ensure we were comfortable, happy and satisfied with our stay. As a result of all the trouble we went through, we checked out the very next day, even though we had a two week long stay that was prepaid. We have never been disrespected, treated this poorly or spoken down to before. It took far too many times finally have our feelings and thoughts understood correctly. We repeat that this was at the exception of only one employee there, because it is clear that everyone else we dealt with need a refresher on their customer service skills, and basic manners. To anyone reading this, yes it has great location near Times Square but you're wasting your time to book here. If you have any issues, I wish you luck in having them resolved, as they will fall upon deaf ears. In our experience, this hotel will not cater to even the simplest requests. It is safe to say we will not be staying here ever again.NB. A rating needs to be included but if I could, I would put 0/5.","Thank you for your review about your recent experience. Your candor is appreciated, and we are sorry for the issues that you encountered at our front desk. This is not typical of our service, so we apologize that we fell short. We have shared your comments with my Front Office Manager to take immediate measures to prevent this in future.

Stay away from the foam bed. it feels like you are sleeping in a shallow tub of warm water.my 6th floor room was hot and stuffy, even with the sliding door to the balcony open on a cold night.Then there was the near-disaster in the shower.I turned on the shower and the shower head, under high pressure water, broke loose from the spout. This heavy, metal shower head flew across the bathroom under great force. If it had hit me it would have certainly split my head open.At the advice of the front desk, I ordered a pizza from the little bar restaurant in the hotel. It tasted like and had the texture of a microwaved Pizza. It was soft and mushy all the way through.Unless you are driving a smart car, the parking garage is so congested and cluttered, navigation is just about impossible. And they charge you about $38 per night for this parking.Then there's housekeeping. I asked the front desk to try to solve the miserable bed problem by having housekeeping put a few layers of insulation or cushion between me and the mattress. While I was at the gym, someone from housekeeping stopped by and through three comforters on my couch. I guess the solution was for me to sleep on the couch.I was in Seattle for 5 days on business.

When the TV was on with normal volume and when the air kicked on you could not even hear the TV. So if you ticked up the TV volume and then when the air conditioner stopped the TV volume was way over a comfortable level.I said above in the title this was just about the worst place I have stayed. Second only to a Days Inn somewhere in KS that was downwind from a cattle feedlot. Even that old style noisy air conditioner was better than the Marriott.The front desk would not help and said that the load noise was what was in every room. They said that they could not help by moving us since all rooms had the same system. Ran into one of the assistant managers on our way out of the hotel on the first day of our four day stay and he said he would look into this. Never heard back.Needed to be in the area and had a pre-pay reservation on a busy New Years weekend. Thus I could not move hotels.Rarely will I write a bad review but these guys do not deserve anyone‚Äôs business. Failures at several levels from the front desk, an assistant manager and the engineering guys that had the crap system in the first place.This stay was so bad I am even going to go from the top down at Marriott HQ to raise my complaints.","Good Day DSDSFrisco,Thank you for taking time to provide feedback of your recent stay. We take great care to ensure all guests enjoy a positive, memorable experience, and clearly we fell short with you.

My family and I usually stay at its sister property, JW Marriott. However, due to our longer stay we opted for the convenience of a suite with kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised! The customer services at the valet, front desk and coffee bar in the lobby was on point. The modern design of the hotel was very appealing from the common areas to the room details. The in-room kitchen was great bonus and breakfast buffet expansive.However, I was disappointed to know there was no in-room service option. I also noticed that with the exception of the lobby, valet and the 2nd floor lounge, service staff was non-existing. On one day, while pool side all the towels had been used and there was no one in sight for hours to ask for assistance. I also missed having pool side drinks and food service. Overall, it was a comfortable and decent stay, but we will be defiantly returning to the JW Marriott for their amenities.","Dear love2travel79,Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences regarding your recent stay at the Los Angeles LA LIVE Residence Inn.

We waited a full hour and I went up to the desk and asked what the deal was, we had been traveling several hours and wanted to cool off in the pool. After some himming and hoing they said they had the room in a handicapped version and that could be ready in five more minutes. We did get that room. The room was clean but the pull out couch was awful and the bedding was not in the closet where it was supposed to be so we had to call. We had to leave early and the ""free"" breakfast isn't until 6 or 7 (don't remember which), so keep that in mind if you are leaving early. The pool was very nice and so was the bar. The beds were also nice with down comforters.The next morning when we checked out I asked for some compensation for our ""hour"" wait. The room was not that cheap and I felt we deserved something. The desk person said she couldn't do anything until her ""manager"" came in and that was not until noon. I told her I had an early flight and would be long gone. After some more himming and hoing she gave us a free parking pass, so I guess they gave us the $19 in parking free...well whoopee and I had to ask for it, they offered nothing, I don't even think they said sorry. Will never stay there again. I think they overbook as I saw ""several"" people waiting for their room in the lobby and we checked in an hour later than check in time so their rooms were really late. Their check out time is noon, maybe they should make it 11. Nothing annoys me more than not being able to check in after a hot day of traveling.

I wish we would have chosen another location. I travel frequently and this is the dirtiest Residence Inn I've ever stayed in, with pretty poor service. I am a Platinum Marriott member and at check-in, the assistant manager was terribly rude and dismissive and charged me $12 for a bag of chips and a bottle of water while we (toddler, infant, and I) waited almost two hours in the lobby for our room. The next morning, there wasn't enough food at breakfast and there was trash and sticky, dirty spilled juice puddles all over the place, like it hadn't been cleaned in weeks. When we came back, we were given early check-in by a sympathetic front desk clerk (a little bright spot!), but the room was gross with food (?) smeared on the bathroom walls, mystery stains on the carpet, a fold-out couch so beaten up and grimy that I couldn't even put my daughter on it, and a missing deadbolt.

However, this particular visit made my smooth vacation an absolute nightmare. Everything was perfect until I checked my card upon departure at the airport and saw that I was charged $250 twice. I called the hotel immediately and they told me that they charged my card an additional $250 because there was a strong smell of smoke in the room i occupied and there was nothing they could do. What???? Ive never smoked a cigarette in my life! I had to scrounge up extra money to pay for my bags at the airport to get home. When I requested to speak to upper management to get the mistake corrected they gave me a phone number that kept giving me to the same front desk person I had just spoken to. I have left several messages for the general manager and as of yet, no one has contacted me to rectify the situation. I will be contacting the corporate headquarters. The Marriot brand has always been my first choice but after this frustrating and ridiculous ordeal I will never stay at another one again.","Good Day Ms. Marshall,The hotel has a ""No Smoking"" policy. If you would like to discuss the justification for the charge please feel free to contact me at the hotel.

The location is great for visiting Coconut Grove. But honestly this property needs a gut renovation and was the worst RI in which we've ever stayed.Positives - Great staff, renovated kitchen, reasonable/typical RI breakfast.Negatives - The room and its furnishings felt worn and tired and smelled a bit 'off'. Worse, the overwhelming odor was that of the kind of chemicals they used to use in hotels to cover stale cigarette smoke. The hotel is actually a collection of buildings with exterior hallways which gave it that 'motel' feel. And to add insult to injury we had a not so charming 'parking lot' view.In short, if you just need a hotel room in Coconut Grove you should consider somewhere else.

The one-bedroom suites feel like a nice little apartment.Cons- THE NOISE! My god, you will hear every word that your neighbors say. It's maddening.- The smell. This is an old property. Every room in every building is musty.Other things:- Parking. Don't fret about this. It's an unconventional setup but parking is ample and you'll have a spot. There's surface parking behind large, opaque metal gates, or a rather dungeon-like parking garage.- Exterior doors. I actually felt quite safe. In addition to the gates all around the property, the doors have two substantial locking mechanisms. I felt just as secure as in any other hotel room.It's a toss up as to whether I'll ever return to this hotel again. I probably would if not for the noise. I wish they would just raze the property and start over from scratch.","Dear guest,Thank you for taking the time in writing your review.

It turns out that it was more of a studio, not a one bedroom. The bed was in an alcove off to the side with no hint of privacy from the living area.It was clean and well equipped and had a nice little kitchen and very nice bathroom. Sad to report that in the kitchen, the dishwasher door couldn‚Äôt open fully because it runs into the refrigerator. A bit of a design flaw there that could be corrected by installing a counter depth refrigerator.On check in, the ice maker was empty and turned off and there no ice machine on the floor. We were told we could get ice a the front desk, but when we got there found that hey couldn‚Äôt offer an ice bucket to take ice back up to the room. I‚Äôm sure there‚Äôs some good reason for always turning the ice makers off and emptying it. But in this case it was quite inconvenient.A nice breakfast was offered in the morning but the kitchen layout was small and very crowded. The waffle maker was at the end of the line after the eggs, bacon, and sausage. People waiting for waffles became somewhat of a roadblock to the line.Staff at the registration desk were very friendly and helpful.There‚Äôs not much around this hotel other than a big mall about 7 miles away. The hotel offers a shuttle service up to 5 miles away. It wasn‚Äôt clear if they would take you to the mall which is 7 miles away, but we did not need it or ask.","Dear macphd,Thank you for taking your time to write a review on TripAdvisor.

A drawer pull was broken and was falling off. The glasses and some utensils in the kitchen were dirty. The kitchen was not well-stocked. I complained to the manager and we were given a different room that appeared clean.Now - the kicker - bonvoy membership penalties. Their website indicates that you will receive the best rate guaranteed. I booked 4 nights at this hotel several weeks before our arrival over their website. The rate was $159/night. Travel plans changed as I needed to arrive 1 night earlier. The reservation allows for an easy ‚Äúclick‚Äù to modify. On the road, that‚Äôs exactly what I did to add 1 weekday night. Once I did that, I noticed that something was wrong with the rate - it was now $189/night. I decided to straighten it out at the hotel. On arrival I explained this to the clerk and asked her to amend the rate to the 159 rate on my original booking. I also explained that TripAdvisor‚Äôs rate was $152. She told me that it‚Äôs always best to book on another website to get a lower rate. Lowest Rate guarantee?? She didn‚Äôt get it so I thought I‚Äôd straighten that out with management in the morning. The next day the supervisor apologized and said he could adjust the rate for nights going forward but he couldn‚Äôt do anything for nights already billed at the higher rate.Bottom line: called Bonvoy and they‚Äôll get back to me in 5 days. I was told in the future (if there is one with this chain) don‚Äôt use the ‚Äúmodify‚Äù icon on an existing reservation. Do a separate booking for that extra night. By the way - the Bonvoy rep said their site IS the lowest and you can file a complaint on the site if you find a lower rate elsewhere. I tried that but it didn‚Äôt work. Well - I‚Äôm sure once my 5 days in purgatory is up they‚Äôll make this right. What a...relief??",Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your feedback.

Room is clean but sparse and hotel is dated. Miami is expensive, and I was not sure what to expect at the relatively low price I paid. Other than the experience being a little too ""budget"" for my standards, my only complaint was that the room smelled like bathroom or floor cleaner had been applied (bleach?) when I walked in and I had to let it air out for a couple hours, which seemed to help. The breakfast was a basket with a bagel, cream cheese, fruit in a packaged cup, and maybe a couple other items (not buffet style). I was on the first floor and there was a couple above me that were rocking the bed springs for a good 1/2 hour, then a pause, and then they started again. It didn't bother me because it was only about 6pm and I wasn't ready for bed yet.","Dear Jason, Thank you for staying at the Shalimar and your comment.

That said, everything worked fine, except for one electrical socket. The AC worked, the shower was warm, the lights worked. I didn't use the TV so I can't comment on that. WiFi is fast.Breakfast is decent: coffee, bagels, fruit cup, orange juice in a cup, and yogurt.The staff are polite and generally helpful. Your room is cleaned every day unless you hang a ""do not disturb"" sign on the door.The one thing that I would recommend changing about the bed is that it only has a sheet covering, not an actual blanket. This was okay for me because I was in Miami, where the weather is usually warm. However, some folks may need a blanket.The location is close to the beach and downtown.All in all, this was a comfortable, average motel at a decent price (about $330 total for 2 people for 3 nights).","dear guest. that you very much for your review, we hope to see you again in our motelkind regards",Trip type: Traveled with friends,Date of stay: November 2015,"Response from Jelena V, Reputation Manager at Shalimar Motel","Responded Feb 27, 2016",19,35.06,99.0,1.0,99.0,9.5,10.53,94.74,57.89,31.58,26.32,0.0,10.53,15.79,0.0,0.0,5.26,0.0,15.79,0.0,10.53,0.0,0.0,10.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.26,10.53,10.53,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,36.84,0.0,10.53,0.0,0.0,5.26,0.0,0.0,5.26,5.26,0.0,0.0,5.26,5.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,15.79,15.79,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.53,5.26,10.53,0.0,5.26,5.26,5.26,5.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,10.53,5.26,5.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,4.8,0.8147619047619048,1.227142857142857,1.189523809523809,306.9578746618889,600.5774013673889,0.0,0.0,0.0,-0.06405263157894737,0.08376571998364529,0.2184999143785332,0.09087585399709433,0.1954844448098388,0.040011387908019,-0.2514166666666666,0.2571428571428572,0.024295609885346,0.1761182496831706,0.1824533069431525,0.3836000000000001,0.5748,0.7656000000000001,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.09523809523809523,0.1428571428571428,5,-30.0,False,Unaffiliated

In fact, I would say the only good things about this hotel are all based on it‚Äôs location. If all you care about is proximity to the airport, this is your spot. The property sits as the first building outside of the airport and has a free shuttle that comes every 15 minutes or so, both pickup and drop off were easy and timely, and again VERY speedy. It also sits across the street from one of the airport train‚Äôs stops. So, it‚Äôs no surprise that most of the other guests seemed to be pilots and crew and/or families getting ready or returning from cruises. Otherwise, our experience was a mixed bag of mostly weirdness/disappointment.Check-in was efficient, and the staff was friendly, and we were even informed we‚Äôd been upgraded to their ‚Äúnicest room,‚Äù a two story suite. Our excitement quickly abated when we entered the room. It‚Äôs true this was a two-story room, but it was super awkward. You could enter from the hallway of either of two floors, downstairs had a TV, and then mismatched chairs, no couch. The bathroom on this floor was actually nicer than the one in the bedroom, as it had a vent fan, while upstairs did not. To get upstairs, your choices were to exit, and go up a floor and reenter, or take a spiral staircase that legitimately had us worried about its structure up to the lofted bedroom. Now even if this had been a magnificent stair case, it‚Äôs spiral nature would have made moving bags from floor to floor difficult at best from within the suite.The upstairs bedroom was fine enough, but again the bathroom was worse than the living area bathroom, and there was no seating besides the bed. What should have been the suite‚Äôs showcase, a two floor window out onto the golf course and canal, was in serious need of replacement/upgrade as it was molded/fogged over for most of it‚Äôs area. In short the room felt more like a weird 1970‚Äôs mountain motel than ‚Äúthe best room we have.‚ÄùEating opportunities were also a disappointment. The lounge was actually wonderful, which I think is an underrated aspect of even US-based Sheratons. Plenty of drinks to pick up and a solid breakfast. Dinner however was a different story. The lobby has two restaurants although it was hard to tell if either was open. We sat at the bar and they gave us menus for both, which were strangely very similar, and the food itself was bland, but got the job done.If overnighting again, I‚Äôd probably go farther afield and try something different, unless they had remodeled. Again, this was super easy, but the room would lead me to try a different, slightly further away property.","Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for staying at The Sheraton Miami Airport Hotel & Executive Meeting Center. We appreciate your feed back. We are currently in the process of making changes to our suites. I apologize for your experience while staying with us and thank you for recognizing the service of our staff.

The problem was reported to front desk but nothing was done. Toilet became blocked but no toilet brush was provided which could have been used to free it so front desk had to be informed who dealt with the problem quickly and efficiently. We were on the third floor right next to a building site where work started at 06:30 in the morning. Luckily we were getting up early so it did not cause too much of a problem. Apart from the problems, the hotel was spotless and very efficiently run. If it were not for the problems we had I would have given five stars.","Dear Inspire818616,Thank you so much for your feedback.

The entire reason why I spent more to stay here than other choices. The free parking is great if you drive a teeny tiny Suzuki Swift, and there are not enough spaces for the amount of hotel rooms books. So, get there first! The free breakfast is not that great, 1 day maybe 2 at the most, but day 3 on we were eating elsewhere! The free shuttle is good if it is available, had to uber it many times because of this. The rooms were fairly clean, had a paper everyday, the staff was great except for the smart mouth shuttle driver. However, if you think the view room or the aforementioned free items are worth the extra $100+ a night, don't buy into it!!!","Dear dannys58,Thank you for staying with us during your recent trip to Seattle. I am disheartened that your experience did not meet your expectations. Our complimentary amenities such as our parking can save in out of pocket expenses as many Hotels in the area charge over $40 a night for parking. We do recommend that guests sign up for the shuttle service to ensure that there is enough space to accommodate your party. Our breakfast offers scrambled eggs, sausage and rosemary potatoes daily along with a rotating specialty item and fresh pastries from a local bakery. It is our team's goal to offer the friendliest service with the cleanest amenities and we invite you to stay with us again during your next trip to Seattle.

However the hotel wasn't up to the normal standards of a Marriot hotel. The good first- my room was just off the elevator but I didn't hear noise from it (other than a few loud kids). The bed was Marriot comfy. The room was generally well appointed. However, The public restroom was not complete. It didn't have soap. It was a little dirty and it had a slide type door lock - very strange for this quality hotel. The plumbing in the room made a very high pitch noise a good portion of the night like it was trying to clear air in the lines. (Fortunately this sound went away by midnight). The couch in the room had some strange fuzzy stuff on it. The shower and toilet area door didn't allow you to easily close it. The TV cable kept fuzzing out.

There were twelve of us in three rooms. When arriving, I checked on the status of all of the rooms since everyone else was flying in that afternoon. I was told that three out of four rooms were paid in full and one room the card had been declined. The agent told me that we could fit everyone in three rooms and she could just cancel the fourth room since we wouldn't need it anyways. After checking with the group I went ahead and did so. I was informed that all that was required at this point was the deposits for the rooms. I paid the deposit for the room I wad staying in ($20 on debit card or $50 cash), received the keycards and went to relax. Later, on checking my account I noticed that the hotel had charged my room $122 instead of $20 as discussed. I went down to ask and found out that the room I was in had not actually been paid for. The staff apologized and then stated that they couldn't really do anything. I paid for a room I was told had already been paid in full. I was really disappointed that they did this as I wasn't booking a room and was staying in someone else's. It worked out in the end as the person who had cancelled their room paid me along with two pother persons to cover staying in the hotel room but they should really be more clear and careful with their charges. When we checked out, I was charged for hotel transportation to the pier that I had not asked for. They took the charge off but it was another headache. They served breakfast and it was small but enough to fill us. The rooms were fine and we had no complaints. The beds were comfortable and the business ctr had a printer even though it was two computers with one not working. This hotel is located near a hospital which is good for people coming for procedures. Don't expect to be able to walk places around it though. It's in a seedy area and doesn't feel very safe.

It was efficiently laid out.One complaint I do have is, the loveset was FULL OF CRUMBS! If it weren't for the crumbs, this would have been a 4 star review. I literally had to remove the cushions and get all the crumbs off, then under cushions was like full of crumbs too! Wowzers! We ended up not sitting on it and placed our luggage on it.

768,30,30.0,30.0,-30.0,,,,,,,,,,apologyHmmwheredoIstart,SpringHill Suites New York Manhattan/Times Square South,20,"Hmm where do I start. It's not the worst hotel I have ever stayed in but definitely in the low end. If you have very low expectations to your hotel you will probably be fine hence the 2 stars.A bit about the hotel itself. It says ""new"", but it's actually just renovated which you can clearly tell on the inside. Rooms are VERY small, some of them can barely fit the king size bed. Most bathrooms have a sliding door facing the bed which is a bit uncomfortable. The rooms have a ventilation system besides the AC unit which is quite noisy and cannot be turned off. If you are on the top floor it will sound like a hurricane just outside your door (I brought one of the front desk guys up there and he was even shocked).Elevators are a chapter for themselves, they are very slow and in some rooms you will hear them operate with banging and buzzing sounds.Breakfast is free and decent but basically quantity over quality. Staff are friendly but don't seem to have the power to properly handle and compensate issues.But let's dig into why it was an unpleasant experience for me. I stayed for 5 nights and basically spent the first 24 hours switching rooms until I found one that was tolerable. They kept saying that they were fully booked but somehow found rooms once I insisted. As compensation for my trouble I was given a free drink at the bar which turned out to be only valid for some pre-made punch. Sigh.In summary, the hotel has a good location but is severely lacking in quality. And the high price is in no way justifiable. I would not recommend a stay in this hotel.","Dear mortenw386,We want to thank you for choosing to stay with us and for taking the time to post your candid review.

We arrived early but we couldn't check in until 3 and the game started at 1 so no luck with that. The person at the front desk wasn't very pleasant but maybe it was because they were busy. The hotel is walking distance to the convention centre and many things. We walked to the cheesecake factory for dinner. The room was ok but very dated. The bathroom had a mouldy picture on the wall from the shower steam I assume and the mirror above the sink had water damage so it looked really dirty. The bed was lumpy and not very comfortable and the pillows were terrible. They have a fantastic breakfast in the morning which was a great surprise. The dining room isn't very big but the food was really good. They have coffee 24 hours a day, a bar, newspapers to read and a convenient area to pick up munchies to purchase. It was an OK place.","It was a delight to have you! You should always feel welcomed when you arrive here.

The location was convenient to the highway, but a long (if doable) walk to the main Seattle attractions. The lobby was nice. Breakfast was good, and the breakfast staff was nice. The room itself was pretty mediocre. I noticed mold in the bathroom, and the carpets were old. The room could have used more storage/drawers for clothing and personal items. Front desk staff was pretty bad. They didn't seem particularly willing help me when asked. My parents stayed a few days later and had terrible customer service from a front desk employee, so that has further detracted from my opinion of the hotel.

So the next day, when we finally arrive, I called the Hotel from the airport to confirm our reservation and to let them know that we are arriving. The hotel front desk staff (Night shift) a middle eastern sounding man, told us that because we did not arrive on our supposed arrival the booking was cancelled. The argument started and they want us to pay them anew for us to be able to check in... WHAT? I do not recommend this hotel to anyone. The only person pleasing in this hotel is the African American lady working night shift in their restaurant. She is the only one that made our stay in this hotel less stressful.

In general, the apartment is quite well but not recommended for those who want to visit the city of Miami (city centre or Miami beach) because you will need to take the car nearly for everything, and due to the traffic jam you will probably waste a lot of time. Moreover, the bed was not really comfortable.The staff showed little enthusiasm about helping so don't expect that they solve your problems (at least in a good way). In fact, following their instructions, I paid in advance for the booking reservation a greater amount than the final cost of the apartment, I didn't know that until the check-in at the hotel/apartment because they informed me and also told me that at the ckeck-out they will give me back the money. When the check-out, I asked for my money and the receptionist (who was another one because it was during the morning and not the evening as the first day) told me that he couldn't help me because he didn't know anything about it. He asked to his colleague and after verifying it through the Hotel bill, they promised me that they will transfer me the money to my bank account. To this day I'm still waiting for it or at least an asnwer to my emails claiming for a solution.In conclusion, if you go to Habitat Residence, be sure that you pay the exact amount or don't expect to recover the extra sum paid because of their own instructions.","Dear Patricia, thank you for letting us know, we are working on your situation directly.",Trip type: Traveled with friends,Date of stay: December 2017,"Response from TeamHabitatResidence, Manager at Stay Alfred Brickell","Responded Feb 2, 2018",15,52.71,99.0,43.37,99.0,15.0,33.33,80.0,46.67,26.67,26.67,0.0,13.33,13.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.33,6.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,26.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,13.33,13.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,33.33,0.0,6.67,0.0,0.0,13.33,6.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,6.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,26.67,20.0,6.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,0.0,13.33,0.0,13.33,0.0,6.67,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,20.0,6.67,13.33,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.1,0.59,0.9444444444444444,1.106666666666667,324.4146510850667,573.0484781743332,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0745,0.08773463264346694,0.06582185289836506,0.1559294194297704,0.05676368318103103,0.3005603325073929,-0.3131111111111111,0.5728571428571428,0.024295609885346,0.1517714109439255,0.3470106355837356,0.42,0.6228333333333332,0.7701666666666666,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.1111111111111111,0.1111111111111111,6,-23.333333333333332,False,Unaffiliated

Waited quite a while for the shuttle bus then rang the hotel and gave our bus stop location.When it arrived it only stopped for a short time before almost leaving without us. The bus wasn't up too much and not one word was spoken from the driver. Not even an hello.The receptionist then allocated us a room that turned out to be occupied when we tried to gain entrance! We were then given a much smaller room than the booked one. Eventually we had a fairly nice room except for the nasty sharp tacks in the carpet by the bathroom area. Despite requesting a quite room this room overlooked the road at the front and was close to the train station which we couldn't see when we arrived as it was dark.The train horns started at 3am and continued loudly through the night.We headed down to the bar at 8pm which was very ordinary but left after half an hours wait without any staff attending!Breakfast was fine, just the usual. Really annoying loud staff and even louder construction workers having breakfast too. No sign of any management through out our stay.The only positive was the very comfortable bed.Definitely will not be returning and will go back to The Elements hotel further down the road. A much better hotel and better managed.","Hello ChiltrenBD,Thank you for your overnight stay and for taking the time to leave us feedback. While I am glad that the bed worked for you, I am sorry to learn that the level of service received fell below expectations. Along with your observations about the noise level in the room, I have shared your comments with the hotel management.

Called prior to arriving to the airport to arrange shuttle service, and was told to call when we were at baggage claim. Called from baggage claim and was asked which door we were at, I stated we were at baggage claim door 3. The hotel said great that they would pick us up from there. I had a party of 8, we waited and waited. Finally calling back and was told no that we had to go up stairs and wait on the level above. We all went upstairs and waited at door 3, I called back again and was told ""Oh no, they could only pick up at door 5. so we all drag down to door 5. While this is a slightly annoying, it was just the start of the issues.When arriving, we checked in and was told the kitchen was open till 11, which it was 9pm at the time. Great we were all hungry. We put our items in the rooms and went down to order, which we were told by the bartender, that he didn't think the kitchen would cook for us because he thought they were going home. Had to have the front desk manager go into the kitchen to cook for us.When arriving to the rooms, 1 room was completely unclean. Bed was not made, trash in the room etc. Had to change rooms. The second room was also full of trash and had not been cleaned either. When speaking about this with the housekeeping manager, another guest came up and began complaining about the same problems in his room. I asked to speak with the general manager, but she would never reach out to us.The hotel is pretty and new, but there are some issues with staffing and cleanliness.","Hi, shelleyb1010!Thank you for stopping over before going on your cruise.I am glad that you find our location convenient.

However there are few things to consider before you stay here. They alow dogs, which it is not per se a bad thing, but they should at least ask you if you mind to have a dog barking in front of your room. I left a small bag with some jewelry and I notified them the following day of my check out and they said housekeeping did not find anything, so I would say, that department is not 100% trustworthy. I lived in Seattle for 10 years and I knew that Aurora is a busy Avenue but I mistakenly assumed this hotel would have proper windows to avoid the noise from the Avenue, they don‚Äôt.The location is convenient and the hotel overall is nice, just these few things to keep in mind.","Hi aygabriela09,Thank you for taking the time in posting a review about our property on TripAdvisor.

There was No hot water from the shower, after leaving the shower run for over 6 minutes 38 seconds, Yes I did time it, we ended up with no running water from the shower. After 4 days of complaining about the water we gave up. No compensation was suggested when we complained every day, they could have suggested to move our room or drink voucher or something but nothing.My niece asked reception for recommendations on where we could eat, they suggested their restaurant. Which we decided to try as there was 12 of us, all staying at the Paul.Reception told us to order at the bar but we could sit downstairs as there was not enough room for everybody. Well we weren‚Äôt allowed to sit downstairs as the Barman told us we weren‚Äôt allowed.After spending $200 on drinks before dinner, we all put our order in at the bar. My husband asked for 3 things off the menu but was told they had run out. After ordering our food 3rd in the group, everyone received their food & had finished their meals before we were told there was no more Ravoli, which I had ordered,after a friend in the group had ordered the same after us & recieved her meal. When we inquired about our meal we were told my husbands chicken burger was coming. Then low & behold a chicken & veg comes out which no one had ordered so I took that.The poor barman was run off his feet trying to get our drinks as well as other patrons & running downstairs to bring up our meals as well. Reception should have never recommended we should eat there if they weren‚Äôt staffed properly.Great location but not recommended for families.","Dear Honored Guest,Thank you for your review.The issues identified were shared with the team and corrective actions were taken to ensure no re-occurrences. Our restaurant is known for its delicious freshly cooked meals and I apologize that the meal you ordered was not available. Prior to your orders the restaurant had four large groups of guest hence there was indeed limited inventory on the ravioli. Your complain was received about the hot water and our engineer explained how to operate the shower leaver to attain the desire temperature and water flow, hence the shower was working properly. This review had motivated the team to add more seating capacity at the lobby Bar so as to ensure all guest can be seated and enjoy our drinks and food.

The bathroom was also very large with a great shower. The bed was pretty comfortable, too. The location is unbeatable - just around the corner from the 28th St-Broadway Subway station and an easy walk to bars in Chelsea and down to Union Sq. The only thing that really annoyed me was the weird sound the AC unit made every time it turned off - it literally woke me up all night long during both nights of my stay. If they were to fix the AC noise, I'd stay again. Otherwise, it was nice but I'll look elsewhere for my next trip.","Dear Roger,Thank you for taking the time to write a review of your experience with us.

Was booked as part of a package deal by an agent.Positives:Great central location. Starbucks, deli, subway and supermarket just round the corner. Near a lot of the tourist spots so was a great base for our tripRooms were very clean and beds were really comfy including the pillows.There were USB points in the bedside table which were helpfulSafe and hairdryer in rooms.Shower was really good and powerful. Little nightlight thing in bathroom so could see to use at night without waking up other person in the room.Negatives:Rooms are tiny and I mean crazy small. Didn‚Äôt even have enough room to open our suitcases on the floor. No where really to store suitcases when empty either. I used mine as a bedside table.Wardrobe has safe under hanging rail so not enough room to hang anything longer than a child‚Äôs shirt. Hanging rail basically pointlessNo hooks or anywhere to hang coats which would have been helpfulStaff a bit slow at responding to requests and didn‚Äôt seem to understand anything at all.Room service didn‚Äôt come every day and when they did they came at 4.30 in the afternoon despite being asked to come earlier as this was generally when we went back for a rest and refresh.Generally overall a great base for sightseeing and we all got good nights sleep. It is mega noisy from the traffic but this is just what you get in a city. We enjoyed our time in NEw York but think I‚Äôd book somewhere a bit bigger next time.","Hello celaine_pete,We thank you for sharing your review with us.

The only pro is the location, but other than that it is not worth it and this is definitely not a 4 star hotel. What others said about the construction going on is very true - understandable and this is not the hotel‚Äôs fault, BUT the noise from the AC is unbearable. There was another loud noise that I recorded and showed it to the manager ( it happened multiple times a day) when she heard it, she said it was from the AC or the vacuum, then I figured out is came from the mini fridge. The windows are filthy, which ruins the great view of the ES (another pro) Our second day we left at 10 am and returned at 11:00 pm, I only wanted to shower and go to sleep. No towels!! Called the front office and requested towels, after 40‚Äô I decided to use the hand towels. Called again and let them know I was going to sleep to please not send anything...as soon as I fell asleep, they came to deliver the towels ( it was way past midnight). The AC was either freezing or way to hot, so we asked for an extra blanket. They delivered the inside comforter without the cover - it was stained and marked with sharpie. Sheets were cheap and pillows were terrible. Breakfast was so terrible that even when we had it included, we did not use the vouchers (2 out of 4 days). The last morning, the eggs were GREEN and the server said that it was because they were too hot - she did offer to make fresh ones which I declined. Bread and bagels were stale and not edible. No cream cheese or fresh cut fruit. Definitely not a full continental breakfast!!! Not worth the $13 if you need to pay for it. The restaurant is dark and the male server was very rude - the lady was nice. Coffee was terrible (burnt). If you have to pay for it, go somewhere else! Lastly, our shuttle was scheduled for 3pm, I requested a courtesy late check out due to all the problems I had. They let us stay until 1pm, but we were out and it was so hot we needed to take a shower before getting on the plane so we stayed until 2:40 in the room and they charged us $35 - which they advise they would do- I am sure I will get the standard response from management, but what I would like is a partial refund!","Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed review of your stay and express your concerns.

At check in, the front desk staff was uncaring and unconcerned. He told us nothing about the hotel, its dining options, etc. He kept stressing that check in was not until later in the afternoon, which we understood. We had plans to go right to the MET, so that was not a problem. We were told that we would receive a call when our room was ready; however, we never received a call. At checkout, I heard the hotel staff tell people checking in that there was a bar on the top floor of the building. We would have loved to go the bar, had we known about it.Now for the room itself. The room was small. There was no chair in the room and no dresser to put clothes away. We lived out of our suitcases and sat on the bed for 3 days. The room had a step-out balcony, but the door would not unlock; therefore, we could not use it.There was mold in the bathroom. The fan made a loud noise, so we had to turn it off in order to sleep--then the room got very stuffy. There was very poor lighting in the room. There was a reading lamp at each side of the bed; however, the lamp on my side of the bed, did not work. Even though there was two of us on the reservation, we were given a room that had only one robe and a rug on only one side of the bed. In addition, the knob in the shower was very difficult to turn.The cafe, where we received breakfast, was disappointing. They do not serve decaf coffee at breakfast. You have to ask for virtually everything, butter for your toast, jelly for your toast, salt and pepper shaker, and a water refill. Again a very uncaring, unconcerned staff.The positive is that the WiFi is good. The bed was comfortable. Prosecco is served at night--again they don't let you this, we just happened to return to the hotel when it was being served. The location is good, especially if you take a train from Grand Central.","LiJo4145,Thank you for your recent stay and taking a moment to outline your experience.

It‚Äôs maybe, MAYBE, a 3.5 star. The pictures are deceiving. The rooms are very small. From my past reviews, you can see that I‚Äôve stayed at a few different hotels in NYC. For the price point, you have many other options. This is labeled/marketed as a trendy hotel. Don‚Äôt fall for it.The staff are rude & unaccommodating.In this part of Manhattan definitely avoid the Maxwell & this hotel unless you don‚Äôt care about value for dollar versus other potential properties you can stay at.","MichaelsUS5825EB,Thank you very much for your candid review of your recent stay at our hotel.

The only reason I‚Äôm staying here is because I wanted a Hilton property for points. I would have taken a later flight had I known they wouldn‚Äôt have rooms ready in a reasonable time. Also, several travelers have come in after me and been given rooms. No excuse. I won‚Äôt return and will not recommend this hotel to other travelers from my firm.

We can certainly empathize on how it can be frustrating to arrive earlier than the hotel's designated 4pm check-in time and not have a room ready. We also understand it can also be confusing to observe other travelers checking in before you. This is likely because they had a different room type or category reserved.Here at the Bernic our entire team is dedicated to service and ensuring we are making every effort to take care of our guests. This includes providing early access when available, or storing bags and providing a call as soon as a room is ready. In reviewing your reservation details we see that we were able to get you in a few minutes past 2:30p.We are hopeful you will reconsider your decision and we are afforded the opportunity welcome your return.

My wife and I were celebrating our anniversary and decided to stay at the Congress. We ate at the main restaurant for dinner.

The prices while were normal for this type of hotel- they‚Äôre far to high for the quality. Later that night we went down to the lounge- Mike was great- but the wings weren‚Äôt that stellar. The ranch was watery and the wings didn‚Äôt have any flavor. We filled out an express menu for breakfast well before the required 2a time- just to find in the morning- nobody picked it up. I then had to order in the morning by calling down- and simply got- ‚Äúoh we didn‚Äôt take the tag‚Äù. Breakfast itself was okay- but had to pay more since I had to call the order in. Upon checkout- the young lady that checked us out- never asked how the stay was and was very curt. When I mentioned an issue- she didn‚Äôt even seem concerned with solving it or giving an authentic apology.

Pool was clean and awesome on a hot day. Right across the street from a Ross (Wife was very excited about this). Located in Thai town so lots of great Restauraunts close by. Price was also great for the area.The Cons: Upon not so close inspection you can tell this hotel may have been a dump a few years ago, unfortunately the past is glaringly obvious under nothing more than a coat of paint. I'm from Vancouver so i have no problem stepping over the homeless, but they are certainly out and about around this part of town; that being said i didn't feel unsafe or threatened at all.

It was a scary place for our young group of friends and I wouldnt take my family there for sure. No food within walking distance and the pool was not somewhere I would use.

Our first room, shockingly small and barely big enough for the tiny double bed let alone anything else, had a broken window and was on the main road where they were having building work outside! The scaffolding was loose and banged and clanged all night long so we got zero sleep after travelling for 24 hours!! Exhausted we requested another room to which we were sent to the other side of the hotel. The room was still tiny but less noisy and so we stayed there for the duration. The wall paper is coming off in the room, there was no handle on the drawer and out toiletries were not topped up each day so by the 3rd day we had nothing. On the third day at the hotel, we came back to our room after being out all day to find a towel in our toilet, after the cleaner had been. In the lobby, the toilets flooded one day making it horrible by the lifts, another day one of the lifts was broken, and on multiple occasions there were cockroaches everywhere. I‚Äôd like to say that people should avoid this hotel. Here‚Äôs just a snippet of our experience:-The bell hop was insane and argued with himself!!- the toilets didn‚Äôt flush- there were cockroaches everywhere to which the response was ‚Äúhey whatcha gonna dooo‚Äù- we complained to the manager but didn‚Äôt get any responseAwful and ruined our first ever visit to NYC!","Thank you for this most recent review, I have detailed and noted these addressed concerns and apologize we did not meet your guest expectations.

I don't want a response from the hotel as I've seen on here, such as 'contact us directly' there is no point, don't bother, I'm not coming back. The hotel is expensive and over priced. There is no Hollywood experience, it's tat and chintzy. It's got nothing going for it. Gym Is out dated too. As for the quality, you are better off staying at the Hilton up the road.

My spouse was out of cell service, and I did not have the emailed itinerary. I have stayed at the hotel multiple times in the last several months, but I was informed that the hotel policy is that if your name is not on the reservation you cannot be checked-in. The first manager (Kylie) I spoke with reiterated the hotel policy, and she went on to say, ""even your last names are not the same."" I had a digital copy of my marriage certificate and a copy of my spouse's ID, yet that was not sufficient because ""you could've gotten divorced since then."" The comments were irrelevant and aggravating.A Hilton hotel has accepted a marriage certificate but an independently run hotel has more red tape?? Ultimately, I called Hotels.com to update the reservation names. A second Garland manager (Alfred) checked me in, and he gave me more rational explanations about 3rd party reservations having more rules.To the management at The Garland, please work with all your managers on how to de-escalate situations with clients (even your front of house staff apologized that he was not trying to make the situation more difficult.)

The corridor also smells musty and old. The only saving grace is the sea-green tiled bathroom, but still that's tiny.If you insist on an ocean view hotel in Santa Monica, I recommend Hotel Shangri-La, which I stayed at 2 years ago. The ocean view rooms are bigger and have a full view. The bathrooms also also way more comfortable. Pricing was similar to The Georgian.If you just want to stay in Santa Monica, I highly recommend the Palihouse, which I stayed at last week for $473 (incl tax).

Room service was quick and pretty good.Cons:The rooms are dead-silent which is typically a good thing except you can hear a pin drop in the hallway. Turning on the A/C helped drown that out but it made a loud clang every time it would engage and disengage. I measured that interval to be equal to the amount of time it takes to start falling back to sleep.The ""modern"" elevator was broken during my 4-day stay so all guests and employees had to use the much slower, older one. I took the stairs several times after waiting a while but that in itself was frustrating. There's no stairwell, just separate flights that connect each floor.My last issue is admittedly something that would've required the staff to step outside of their policy but those are the sorts of things that keep people coming back. On the afternoon before my last night, I was able to find an earlier flight so I took it. Once I had confirmation I immediately called the hotel to give up my room. It was escalated to a manager who informed me that I would've had to give notice before noon.

819,9,0.0,10.0,3.0,,,,,,,,,,apologyRecentlystayedsevera,The Inn At St Botolph,20,"Recently stayed several days at the Inn at St. Botolph and left feeling a bit disappointed. Let me start off by saying that the rooms are impeccable decorated. I looked through the pictures on this site and my room is pictures and looked exactly as shown -- gorgeous modern furniture and fine linens. But once you get past the appearance there are some basic flaws which make a several day visit at this price point annoying.I will start by listing the negative and needs improvement aspects of the Inn @ St Botolph and then finish the review with the positive aspects.1) Absolutely no parking. I was warned of this by my secretary before arriving but was told it was easy to find. After driving several hours to Boston, I parked in front of the Inn‚Äôs building at 99 Botolph Street to get my several bags of luggage into the hotel and up the elevator to my room. I called the number on the room phone that said house manager (I believe it was room 109) and the gentleman who answered was very cold, uninformed and said that he didn't know where public parking was located and that the Inn Manager Ryan was not available. Very annoying -- so luckily my iPhone had ""around me"" feature and I was able to find the closest public parking garage about 1.5 blocks away. As this point ‚Äì 30 minutes had passed trying to get the directions and when I looked out the room window to the street there was already a $40 ticket on the windshield of my rental car for parking after 4PM in ""Resident Only"" meters. I drove down to the public garage and the fee was $23 a day.2) I walked back to the Inn from parking and unpacked by bags to find that there were no counters in the bathroom to place toiletries on. I had to place my items on the nightstand or under the sink. There was also no soap self in the shower which meant shampoo and soap had the rest on the shower floor during the entire visit. Bizarre, but I marked it up to growing pains, as they are a new Inn.3) The security safe on the floor of the small closet was broken and would not stay shut causing the closet door to have issues closing. In such a small room this was creating an issue for me to get passed the bed to the bathroom area. I realized if I placed the ironing board in front of the safe to keep it closed ‚Äì my closet would stay shut.4) I opened my laptop to begin checking emails and look for a nearby restaurant / bar and found I could not connect to the Inn's Wireless Service. I looked around the room and in the drawers for a welcome letter with connection instructions and there were none. Once again, I braved calling the manager on duty and received voicemail (about 7:30 PM). He called back sounding very inconvenienced about 30 minutes later (I felt myself apologizing to him for even calling) and he gave me the pass code for the wireless which I tried but did not work. I wasn‚Äôt about to call back at that point so I emailed the Innkeeper (Ryan) with my issue so he could resolve it. Ryan did not call me on this issue for more than 24 hours -- luckily I had a wireless card that worked close to the window. Once Ryan explained that ""pop-up blocker"" needed to be turned off ‚Äì it worked fine but then the connection expired later that evening and it did not reconnect again for the entire visit.5) The first morning I woke up and walked into the very nicely appointed kitchenette to make coffee (there is a mini-coffee pot), however I discovered there were no small bags of coffee in the room. The coffee basket required the pre-measured packets so I went out and asked the housekeeper in the hall and she said they do not have coffee available for those machines and I could walk 1/2 a block to the 7-11 for coffee. Not cool and not appropriate when you are obviously trying to attract new, discerning customers.6) Although the sheets on the very plush beds were high thread count (probably Frette) the many pillows were very tall and firm -- to the point I was uncomfortable and ended up sleeping between two of them as I could not get comfortable. There really needs to be a mix of pillows for different styles of sleepers.7) Lastly, the elevator down the hall would ""ding"" very loudly every time it opened. Even with my room at the end of the hall -- it could be heard throughout the night. I am sure they can lower the volume or even turn off the floor bell since this Inn is very much like a private residence with keypad entries to the rooms instead of keys.The upside of the Inn at Botolph for the price is:1) Location, location, location!2) Beautifully decorated room.3) Security camera for letting visitors in with.4) Walking distance to Prudential Center, shopping and nice cafes / restaurants.5) Very clean -- daily housekeeper.6) You do not feel like you are in a big hotel chain - very intimate (but you do need some service!).7) Frette luxury bathrobes and plush white towels in bathroom.8) Rain style showerhead in bathroom.9) Windows open fully to allow breeze into room and gives a nice street view.10) Fully stocked kitchen (cups, plates, wine glasses, etc.) and refrigerator has an icemaker.I think once the Inn at 99 Botolph work through the growing pains of being new it will become a truly wonderful place to stay. They need work on refining the guest service dramatically and have the house manager (or someone) greet guests during basic Inn hours. If guests arrive late there should be a welcome letter or phone call from the Innkeeper explaining wireless, nearby public parking, cool places to eat and where to get coffee / breakfast the next morning‚Ä¶ things that you would do if a guest was staying in your home.I hope this review was useful and best regards.Experienced Business and Leisure Traveler","Dear Sir:Your recent review of The Inn @ St. Botolph on TripAdvisor caught my attention. I truly appreciate your feedback and want to assure you that although your experience was atypical, we are taking appropriate steps to see that it remains so.We appreciate you taking into consideration the fact that we just opened and have some growing pains to overcome. In our effort to create an affordable luxury experience, The Inn @ St. Botolph has limited certain services such as the availability of a valet and parking. While this fact already appears on all confirmations, we are making it more visible and will be providing parking recommendations on our website and in the rooms. We realize that you had difficulty and will be more than happy to cover the cost of your parking ticket if you provide us with a receipt.Each room at The Inn @ St. Botolph is unique, and most are equipped with bathroom shelf space. Unfortunately the delivery of the shower shelving was delayed until after our opening, so guests staying in early November did not have the opportunity to use them. In response to your other suggestions, we are currently working with our designer to provide additional shelf space near the bathroom sink and are completing an in-room directory which will clearly explain how to use our free hard-wired and wireless internet along with a quick reference for trouble shooting.We will soon expand our pillow selection and begin including complimentary coffee packets in each room for those guests who do not wish to avail themselves of the coffee, espresso and cappuccino offered with continental breakfast daily in our lounge. The elevator ring has already been addressed and the in room safes have instructions so guests can utilize them with ease.Lastly and most significantly, there is no excuse for making a guest feel uncomfortable under any circumstance. There is no other remedy than to upgrade our service standards and reinvigorate our staff. Trust that each member of our small but dedicated staff has seen your comments and has been reminded of the role they play in guaranteeing the comfort of our guests.I hope that you will take my assurances to heart and will consider returning to The Inn @ St. Botolph.Kindest Regards,Keith BeardsleyDirector of Operations",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: November 2008,"Response from innatstbtolph, Director of Operations at The Inn At St Botolph","Responded Dec 2, 2008",384,72.07,96.15,26.25,85.15,27.43,25.52,86.72,51.3,13.54,9.9,1.04,4.95,2.86,0.0,1.04,3.65,5.99,14.06,8.07,3.39,6.77,1.04,14.06,5.21,2.6,0.78,0.0,2.6,5.99,4.69,1.3,0.26,0.0,0.0,14.32,0.0,1.56,0.0,0.26,10.94,2.34,1.82,1.04,1.82,2.34,2.34,2.6,1.04,0.26,0.78,1.82,0.26,0.52,0.0,1.04,10.42,5.73,1.56,1.56,1.04,0.78,2.6,9.38,2.34,12.5,1.3,7.29,4.17,2.86,3.12,2.34,0.78,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.11,4.95,2.34,0.26,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.52,0.0,0.0,0.0,1.04,149.2,1.220726817042606,1.853934837092732,1.867719298245614,323.5530324777258,582.3892954955054,4.13909090909091,2.43,6.211818181818181,0.009378082191780795,0.2257639624461626,0.2647108449116953,0.233879129208108,0.2652419292859619,0.2625779508101604,-0.3420581395348838,0.3225751295336789,0.2771864952398829,0.1872402910945208,0.4190275802175834,0.4293115942028985,0.559594202898551,0.668369565217391,0.007518796992481203,0.0,0.0100250626566416,0.04260651629072681,0.02756892230576441,4,5.5,True,Columbus

The bathroom was very tired as was the single robe hanging in the closet.There was cute outdoor seating area on the second level, but we were only there for less than 15 hours so we didn't take advantage, or even see the pool or fitness center. The breakfast was also average. The experience was neither fabulous or terrible. Although the Los Angeles area is expensive, I feel we overpaid for this average experience and will probably not stay at the Inn at Marina del Rey again.","Dear JaxSass,Thank you for taking the time to offer us your valuable feedback.

I was surprised to say the least on arrival that the place was in the middle of extensive renovations. It really grinds my gears that I was not informed at the time of booking or any time since that the renovations were happening and given the chance to reconsider my booking but no.The renovations meant there was no reception area and you had to enter through the underground car park. Also there was no dining room so breakfast was served in one of the rooms! This was not ideal and after the first days chaos we didn't bother .The room itself was great, freshly renovated, spacious and clean.The hotel was very accommodating as my daughter flew in from New York to see us and they provided a roll out bed with no charge.It is a great location with walking distance to the Albert Kinney bars and eateries and a quick uber to Venice.It's just a shame our stay was spoiled for me but the lack of openness and honesty over the renovations. Oh, and if you want a quieter room get one away from the road which is very busy.","Dear Gibbo1969,I am delighted that you choose the Inn at Marina del Rey for your visit.

But as a business traveler, I would not choose to stay here again for two reasons:1) The internet connection was so bad I had to give up getting any work done via their wifi and just use my phone. Yes it was free, thank you, thats good, but it also didn't work. At all. And no technical support available.2) Check out is at noon is extremely strict and apparently the rules are more important than the needs of the guest. I did not ask for anything unreasonable or uncommon. Unlike most hotels, here is no convenient lobby space, so I simply asked for 1 hour extension so that I could participate in a conference call in a quiet room. It was made clear to me that 12:30p was the most they would do. After that I would immediately be charged for another day.Of course I complied and checked out on time. But perhaps more bothersome was the attitude of the front desk managers as I checked out. I related my experience and was met with cold shrugged shoulders and a sincere lack of empathy or apology. Really? So business travelers, New York is full of fine hotels. Why choose one that doesn't give a flip about you or your business needs?","While we're glad that you liked the room itself, Kevin, of course we're disappointed to hear that you were less impressed with some other aspects of your stay, like the Wi-Fi and noon check-out.

The hotel is a small hotel on 8th Street, beautifully refurbished from an old rooming house, so the rooms are correspondingly small. But it has a certain vibe; it is well furnished in the main areas, and the rooms are well designed. In-room space can be an issue. The double bed (possibly queen) naturally dominates the room, with no real space around it, so luggage has to be stowed under the bed (not always possible with large suitcases) The wardrobe and mini-bar arrangement is adequate, but a challenge if you have a longer stay and lots of clothes. That said, the linens and towels are first class, and the television is a good size. There is a coffee bar within the main lobby, but no room service. We were there as guests of our family, so did not spend a lot of time in the hotel. However, we stayed 'home' on a couple of evenings and enjoyed dinner from a local deli. There are lots of good places to eat close by, and a great coffee shop next door - Lena's. Staff are helpful and friendly, with the Bell Captain (Dimarcus) especially good to meet and he is both helpful and welcoming. The restaurant staff were okay but on one occasion (breakfast) our Server was surly and that was a disappointment. Overall the hotel is lovely, but boutique hotel usually means small hotel, so bear that in mind.","Hello Mai H,Thank you for your deciding to stay with us once again.

If you're 24 or younger, or you are 40 and identify as 24 or younger as evident by the raucous 40th birthday celebration taking place in the lobby, this is the hotel for you. If not, read on...If I could just rate the woman who checked us in at the front desk, I'd rate her five stars all the way. Competent, polite and understanding; she certainly took her job seriously and I appreciated that. She quickly checked us in after a long drive from San Juan Island and by looking at our Toyota 4Runner with a Thule box on top she promptly gave us access to the available parking spot outside of the garage realizing that we'd never make the low clearance of the parking garage.You read right, if you have a SUV, truck or perhaps a lifted Subaru Outback (we're from Portland, Oregon and it's a thing here) with a travel box on top, forget about parking the the garage, the clearance is far too low. More on parking later in the review.Once parked, it was time to finally unload and we were hoping...unwind. We unpacked the car and headed to our room on the fourth floor. The elevators are unbelievably slow and there are only two. One of which broke down during our stay leaving only one functioning elevator for the entire hotel. Murphy's Law I suppose.You have to insert your key card to access your floor. I'm not sure if this is common for all of the Pineapple hotels, or just The Maxwell Hotel. Either way, I am juggling bags, kids and now fumbling for my room key to just get to my floor.Finally, I slam the key in slot and hit the number 4 for the fourth floor. Once the elevator doors open, I'm greeted by what would appear to be circus colors. Queue the clowns! But, what's that smell?Oh, that's the folks in room 420 celebrating their stay with a nice long toke. No smoking or vaping allowed at The Maxwell Hotel you say? Apparently that rule applies to every room BUT room 420. The entire hall reeked of marijuana. Now before you get upset and judge us as some marijuana prudes, we're from Portland and if Oregon can do one thing right, it's grow and smoke weed. However, the last thing I want to to do is explain to my children the origin of 4:20 during my stay in a rather expensive hotel.Thank God, our room did not smell of pot, but the wallpaper on the walls was anything but relaxing. You're presented two duvets per queen bed and you're scratching your head as to what you're supposed to do. Luckily, they realize this is not normal and provide you with some Ikea-inspired hieroglyphs on how to utilize your ""European"" duvets. Needless to say, the same amount of cursing associated with assembling your Ikea entertainment center commenced.We registered our kids, so I'm not sure if they placed the $25.00 stuffed dog because of that, or if they do it for every room, but there was a stuffed dog that our daughter was dead set on getting.Spoiler alert; it wasn't worth $25.00 and she didn't get it. Parent win!Did I mention that everything in this room is for sale? Yep, you can buy the coffee mug for $25.00, you can buy a mystery munchie box of mystery snacks for $25.00; no, you don't know what's in it, but if you're a gambler you can find out for just $25.00! You can buy branded dog bowls and more! For just $150.00 you can be a Stay Pineapple walking billboard...wonderful!There is branding absolutely everywhere! Just about every surface has a pineapple plastered on it. The glasses have pineapples, the towels have pineapples, the pillows have pineapples, the water has pineapples, everything has pineapples. Not to mention the immature innuendo that is repeated everywhere. You're Do Not Disturb door tag says ""I'm naked"" and the pillows are embroidered with ""Sleep With Me."" We're just a pole away from from feeling like we're sleeping in a strip club.That's not a knock against the Maxwell Hotel, but rather the Pineapple Hotel chain.Finally, we're settled. Our ""high-riding"" vehicle parked, our European-style beds made and the T.V on. Now we're hungry!Luckily McMinneman's is located just across the street, unless you're interested in overpriced sundries at the hotel. From there we were able to wear out the kids with a walk past the Space Needle.A big positive of The Maxwell Hotel; location. You can't beat this location if you're touring Seattle. Close to the Space Needle, Key Arena and the International Fountain, you can really see quite a bit with just a short walk.Our kids wanted to hit the pool...because they're kids...This pool is barely big enough for your grandma! One family at a time. Luckily from our room, we had direct view of the pool through the windows and unfortunately it would seem that families must be lining up for the pool since it was full from 6:30pm - 10:00pm! Sorry kids, no pool for you. You can always take a warm bath; wait, there's no bathtub? Damn.The shower blows water all over the floor because it doesn't have a door or a curtain. I know that when you're completely drunk, this shower is easy access, but not all of us are functioning alcoholics and like to keep the floor dry to avoid unnecessary falls.Speaking of the shower, it almost seems like the hot water is metered. It can be piping hot and after 10 - 15 minutes it becomes ice cold until you crank the the handle to full hot. After an audible thud it then scalds you and you have to readjust it for another 10 - 15 minutes of a hot shower. I can't say it's actually metered, or if it was our room or perhaps the plumbing is old?It's about 10:00pm, time for bed. You'll learn that the TV's in this place will shut themselves off! Yes, that's right, they have built in timers; not a sleep timer, but an actual timer. You have to tell it that you're still watching or it will turn off. Good luck finding the remote when it's pitch black in your room!Check out time.Remember that parking situation? For that limited clearance parking you're paying $37.00 a day PLUS applicable taxes! So you're paying around $50.00 a day to park your car here. Did they tell me when I checked in? No. The snarky young man at the desk told me that there was a sign. He wasn't lying, there IS a sign, but really? $37.00 a night PLUS taxes? Come on. I am already paying nearly $200 a night for this place, you can't comp me some parking in YOUR garage?When we questioned the young man, he basically told us ""oh well, pay up."" According to hotels.com we owed $191.00 for our stay, we ended spending over $250.00!We've stayed in very high-end hotels and none of them were like this. If you're into fake crystal everywhere, mirrors with stickers, circus colors and the stench of weed, this is the hotel for you!","Dear clee109,Thank you so much for taking the time to write a review regarding your recent stay with us.

On a return trip to Seattle, I'd definitely shop around. The room was comfortable. The staff was semi-helpful. It was a bit disappointing that though they acknowledged our special request to give us suggestions to make a birthday special, they never followed through with any suggestions. Though doable, it was a hike to Pike Place Market (especially uphill on the way home). One test that every hotel has to pass with me is keeping a room supplied with toilet paper. They failed when we had to call down for a roll. It was delivered quickly, but why put guests through the embarrassment have having to ask for TP?

Initially they had offered me a double queen, but then booked a king size and never told me we didn't have the double queen. Thankfully I checked much nearer the time. However, it took a while before they accepted the error. Finally, after much effort they did and then they offered a guaranteed and free roll away bed. That's really the least they could do given their error, but we were both comfortable and we had what we wanted.That error aside, once we were there, the room was fine, the gym is pretty good, the staff (reception and housekeepers) were very friendly and helpful.

We stayed in a corner room on the 6th floor. The traffic noise, even with the windows tightly closed is unreal. When the buses (and there are many) stop and go at the traffic light, they sound like a train! The old style fan/airconditioner underneath the window is also noisy and rather than masking the noise, lets the street noise below in. We never heard any noise from neighboring guests but workers were renovating from 11-3 am. It sounded to us like it was coming from the room above - drilling, sawing, hammering. Wearing earplugs didn't help. We phoned the front desk twice and were told different stories. One said it was from the kitchen -6 floors down- we still find it hard to believe. They gave us a free breakfast to compensate us, but our holiday was ruined. Why do they have to renovate at night? I wasn't impressed with its cleanliness either since we found coins laying on the carpet. The sheer curtain was torn, and the room needs updating. The bathroom was lovely and clean.

I like to give positive feedback. my experience with this hotel was so bad I have to share it as a warning.I booked a room online assuming that my State was still on the Covid19 test free list. I accept it was primarily my responsibility to check. It is not the point of this bad review.I checked the morning I was to travel to Boston, only to read I actually needed a test (72 hours). I called to hotel to get clarification. I was told by the manager (who picked up the call) that I needed the test. I said it would have helped it is was clearer when booking. She stated ‚Äúeverybody knows about the testing requirements‚Äù. This is the first insulting statement. I did not know that MA used a rolling 5% infection rate website and that my State had be in and out of that list twice over the last few weeks. I imagine some people reading this were also not aware of this, in cannot imagine everybody was aware. I am not convinced this manager was aware, and if she was it might have been better to offer sympathy and explain it. That was the first insult. She went on to say that I could ‚Äúcancel my stay with zero refund‚Äù. Which is the second and deliberately rude insult. What a welcome. I asked to speak to an owner which she refused saying she is the manager. Third insult.Customer Service is about the way you do things. I am sorry sir, let me see what I can do etc etc. No, I was insulted three times and then they took my $145. No split ,no credit, just rudeness. I have had relatives stay at this hotel once, they will never again. I will never stay there. My hope is that I convince one person to turn to one of the better hotels in Boston if you value a considerate customer service expeince.I am ""out"" $145 and 'in"" three insults.

I have allot of good things to say about the WSI but also allot of negatives. I'll start with the negatives.Negatives:-Hotel offered very poor water pressure (not a major concern)-Hotel room we were provided with offered no mini-fridge-Hotel staff states that air conditioning unit can not be turned down past 70 degrees****MOST IMPORTANTLY****-Hotel room stunk. I stood on the 6th floor and the hotel stunk of mold or moist air. The moisture was so bad that the linens on the bed felt moist at all times (quite difficult to sleep on a bed that is moist and a room that is 72 degrees) My partner and I are very easy going so rather than complain dealt with the situation.Positives:-Great location-Cheap Rates-Nice bed/linens-Clean room-Clean HotelThats really my review of the Wall Street Inn in a nutshell. I would have given the hotel great reviews if the humidity/water vapor/moisture problem was under control. The other issues I listed as negatives were not a problem; after all who cares about a mini fridge and 70 degrees is cool enough for most.Unfortunately, and much to our displeasure and disappointment was the moist rooms. The entire floor stunk and a few other posters have made note of humidifiers (I did not see any). The entire time I was there I thought to myself, ""how come they didnt give me another room?"" because the hotel seemed empty (it was the weekend). The hotel didn't take action to inform us of the 'situation' or take any 'visible' steps to resolve the smell. Oh and as a side note the windows in our 'corner' room had the handles removed so opening the windows was impossible.We did enjoy the trip to the city. I personally would not give the WSI another opportunity. I'd rather have stayed at a chain (and that is very unlike me). If your downtown or in NYC in general you will probably spend very little time in your room so finding a place with a dry comfortable bed and a room with an AC you can control is important to me... especially when its 100 degrees outside.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to write about your experience with us.

But there was no chain on the door, and I had trouble locking it when I left, so I never felt sure it was locked. I'd have given a lot for an ordinary chain. A roaring noise contributed to keeping me up most of the night--possibly an air conditioner in the hall, I'm not sure. I turned off the heating and cooling system in the room but that didn't help. The complimentary breakfast was inedible: fluffy, tasteless bagels and coffee that came from a container that must have once held hazelnut coffee.

The hotel is in an older building and very nice looking. Positives were the price and location. The snacks and the drinks in the honor bar were very reasonably priced. However, there were a whole bunch of other things that led me to drop my rating. First off there was no continental breakfast, despite it being advertised on the website. This very well could have been because of the Covid protocols, but then it should be mentioned on the website. The room was spacious, but the bathroom was not. The toilet sits in a recessed area, and was very snug. There was a small pedestal sink with a narrow shelf above it to place toiletries. There was also a very small cabinet, but that also had towels in it. The shower had very poor pressure, and the tub floor was curved so my ankles and knees hurt after being in there. There soaps, lotions and shampoos were in pump containers, which is good, however there were collars around the pumps so you had to pump excessively to get a fair amount of shower soap. Minor annoyances: The room was long but not very deep. The television was fixed to the wall so you couldn't swivel it for better viewing from an angle. The television had a program guide on one channel, and there was also a two sided channel guide. None of these actually matched the channels programmed into the television in the room. There was not pen to mark items on the honor bar. Lots of little things, plus an uncomfortable bathroom means I won't be returning.Bed rating - comfortable if you like soft beds.",Thank you for your review and for staying with us recently.

I was given room 749 which had an extractor fan in the bathroom that made a loud noise similar to a vacume cleaner that was constant and even with the bathroom door closed it‚Äôs proximity to the bed meant I didn‚Äôt get an ounce of sleep.

I'm referring this time at the outrageous amount of $24.40 they charged me for the right I have as a paying guest to park my vehicle overnight in their parking lot. The charge in question is broken down as follows:Daily Parking: 20.00Miami Parking Surcharge: 3.00Parking Tax: 1.40Keep in mind that this information is not disclosed to you up front when you make your reservation. It's too late when you show up at the front desk to check in and read the sign they have to that effect, which, incidentally, does not mention the additional fees. This is unethical and deceptive.This hotel has nothing to brag about. Their facilities are mediocre and the surrounding area is gloom and depressing. A glorified hostel providing overnight lodging for travelers to and from the airport and the Port of Miami.","Dear rigobertog66,Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your recent stay.I would like to apologize for the misunderstanding of parking fees that must have occurred when booking with us.

But just look at this place, I am a fan of atomic age hotels and roadside hotel/motels. One day I hope to stay a nite at the Madonna Inn or even the tee-pee hotels. I was thrilled, free parking, look at that pool, cute a** rooms. I love mid century modern kitch as much as the next 40yr old. I was not even swayed by the fact there was a humidifier or a loud air conditioner... finally something to drown out my snoring!! Went to bed early, pool music barely audible. Bed so ultra sinkable we were rendered immobile. That is until I looked over at the white plastic alarm clock and thought is that what I think it is. Nah, turning my head away from the alarm clock glow. OH NO then I felt it in my hair. ACK leaping out of bed waking my partner, (after all this was my birthday trip) in this pristine white bed in a spotless room stood a giant palmetto bug on my pillow. I said GET IT (at home I am the one to get it) she drags the pillow off the bed ever so slowly. The bug gallantly riding on the pillow as if floating on a cloud. She says i got it.. i say thats not getting it, then in her sleepy ultimate wisdom she puts the fluffy bath robe over it, STILL NOT GOT IT, i drag the robe covered roach riding pillow to the room door to put him outside and it scuttered under the base board in the bathroom. All in all it was a pretty nice stay at this beautifully renovated mid mod hotel in Miami for my birthday! Even if I woke up to a palmetto bug in my hair in the middle of the night üåô Went for a morning swim and as lovely as the pool was it couldn't shake the thoughts of the roach in my hair. I live in Florida, I have lived in Florida for almost 30 years I understand there will be bugs. I wanted to make this a 2 star review but the hotel is sooo darn cute & the staff from prior to check in through out our stay were amazing.","What can I say besides I am horrified to learn about your experience. The hotel has been open for exactly 4 years and this is the first time we have a guest with ""bug' issues let alone a bug on the bed/pillow. I can only imagine how unsettling it must have been and for that I am truly sorry. You are correct that bugs are common in South Florida but we take pest control very seriously and continuously service the hotel grounds and the rooms to keep the ""bugs"" out.",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: July 2018,"Response from mmallouh, General Manager at Vagabond Hotel Miami","Responded Aug 12, 2018",91,43.96,70.88,28.45,1.0,22.75,14.29,90.11,60.44,14.29,8.79,4.4,2.2,2.2,0.0,0.0,5.49,8.79,10.99,15.38,6.59,6.59,0.0,18.68,3.3,0.0,2.2,2.2,0.0,6.59,1.1,5.49,1.1,1.1,2.2,6.59,0.0,1.1,0.0,0.0,12.09,2.2,2.2,2.2,1.1,4.4,1.1,2.2,0.0,1.1,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,5.49,2.2,1.1,1.1,1.1,0.0,2.2,16.48,0.0,12.09,0.0,7.69,3.3,2.2,2.2,3.3,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,9.89,4.4,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,3.3,1.1,0.0,1.1,36.0,1.203367346938775,1.68530612244898,1.698673469387755,324.3207641326705,592.4036712283978,5.279999999999999,2.313333333333333,4.026666666666666,-0.1677127659574468,0.1621066639457713,0.165073059915822,0.3050915942065334,0.1444786107115039,0.1845767495873124,-0.4415438596491227,0.2541351351351351,0.1794670151354604,0.1127612196526124,0.3584263921153453,0.4143939393939395,0.5037878787878788,0.6042424242424242,0.04081632653061224,0.0,0.0,0.02040816326530612,0.02040816326530612,3,30.0,True,Vagabond Inn

I had to convince the hubby that it will be great. I got the reservation through Hotels.com which I have used before without any issues. I did not realize the reservation was for the ""run of house"", yet description said ""balcony with city views"". So I had a view of a wall. I guess I didn't have to worry about privacy. FYI, if they give you room 412, you're going to have a nice view of the wall.Soon as I got to the hotel, I walked straight to the front desk to check in. Staff is not friendly and warm at all or helpful for that matter. I felt as if I was in the ""wrong"" place. Perhaps they were short staffed. I have never been to a hotel where I have felt I didn't belong. Same for check out.I've paid much, much more for rooms but I have never felt I wasted my money like I did this stay. And it was discounted on Hotels.com.All of that aside, beds were comfy. Location was central to all the places we wanted to hit up. The bathroom was clean, minus one piece of hair in the tub. Housekeeping staff was helpful.Will I stay here again? Probably not. Did I have a great time in Seattle? Yes, most definitely.","Good morning Kristina Y.

The breakfast menu is good and you get it for free if you are an NYU guest.Btw, the room is not sound proof. You could easily hear street noise.

I choose it because I had a 2 night stay in NYC where I know that I would not use the hotel facilities at all. When that is said‚Ä¶The check in at the hotel went nice and easy.. we arrived at 1 o‚Äôclock at night.The room was really really small (Even for NYC standards) and the window was facing an elevator shaft! So if you opened the window it was all smelly and dark outside. When I booked the room this was not stated. The smell was really stuffy.The decoration of the room and the hotel in general is very out dated. So outdated that it is not even nice or fun anymore. The closet was really old. The doors could hardly be closed andThe bathroom is of a newer date. And worked well.Had the quick breakfast in the hotel. But no need to do that.. there is a Starbuck just around the corner.The door men and reception is very nice and welcoming.I will not stay here again. I really do like the district but the hotel I will not miss.,"Hello,We sincerely apologize for the experience you had during your stay with us, and for the miscommunication about the room type.

However rooms have always been odd sized, with typical small bathrooms.This year the person at the front desk told us our room was ready to check in but if we waited an hour we'd get a better room. After walking around a couple hours the room was finally ready. Unfortunately as it turned out the room made clunking noises most of the night. After a few nights we figured out it was a hidden elevator.Also the pillows were too firm and bed was bad , and short?These days there are too many nicer hotels with GREAT beds and pillows.I'm afraid that our years of staying here are over. We already found two new hotels at the same price in good neighborhoods.As always Ronnie the doorman is nice, as is done of the long term desk staff.

When I was checking in, the man at the front desk was very unknowledgeable about the nearby area and there was nobody working at the shuttle service desk, where we were directed to get more information. This was listed as a non-smoking hotel, but when I arrived back to my room late at night after spending the day in the hospital, there was a smell of cigarette smoke so strong it seemed as if something was smoking in the room. The smell was so strong we tried putting towels in the cracks of the bottom of the door to keep the smell from coming over from the connecting room. It didn‚Äôt work. In the middle of the night, my mom and I were both woken up by another strong scent of cigarette smoke. This lasted all night and into the morning. When we left to go check out, we realized the smell was even stronger in the hallway. I am confused why any hotel staff, including housekeepering staff, did not smell this and fix the problem. We reported the terrible stench of cigarette smoke to the man at the desk when checking out and he just diverted the conversation by saying he would have someone else take care of it. Also, when taking a shower the tub filled up with inches of water because it was unable to drain correctly. If the cleaning staff were regularly checking the tub they would easily see there was a big problem. Overall, I was unpleased with the entire stay and would never recommend this hotel to anyone. I stayed at the SpringHill Suites on old Spanish rd a few minutes away for the next 5 days and it was amazing. The rooms were clean and even offered free breakfast for a less expensive price than one night at this unclean, smelly Wyndham.","Dear Guest:Thank you very much for staying with us recently and for taking the time to point out the issues you encountered. I am very sorry that you had to experience the cigarette smell from another guest. We did end up asking this guest to move from the hotel as they violated our Non Smoking policy, but obviously it was too late to assist you. Please know that we receive high scores regarding the cleanliness of our rooms, but did miss the draining issue in your room. I sincerely apologize for all that you encountered and would love the opportunity to make it up to you.

The rooms are ok - they are clean and decently sized but lacking any inspiration. The air conditioning units in them are ancient and very, very noisy.While we stayed there the battery on our room safe expired so I couldn't lock the safe on one day. On checking out we realised an envelope with a few hundred dollars had been taken during this time so look after your valuables.A major problem for this hotel is that the street directly outside is a popular place for the homeless to gather and get quite noisy overnight. So you might be better with a room on the back but then you get the freeway noise instead. Ask for as high a floor as possible for minimum noise - my family slept soundly but I am a light sleeper so was disturbed a few times with shouting from the street. Even without the noise it's not a pleasant place to walk during the night.The pool is useless unless you want to swim right next to the freeway. Use the beach instead.","Greetings Dr. Marc,We apologize for the issues you experienced, however this is the first we are hearing about a missing envelope.

895,15,30.0,30.0,-11.0,,,,,,,,,,apologyStayedatYotelfora,YOTEL New York,30,"Stayed at Yotel for a quick getaway weekend with the boyfriend and we were excited to stay here. I've heard great things about Yotel and the techy side of my bf was excited to see Yobot as well. Booked through a third-party site last minute and it seems that because I booked through a third-party, I was given a room that was probably last sell.Here's the thing - I've toured this hotel before being in hospitality and saw this property, saw the cabins, and had a general idea of what we will be getting. The room we received was very much lacking what I expected. First of all, we arrived late at night and had a little trouble check in - to no fault of the agent checking us in. Apparently there was another guest with my same name, though spelled differently (how it was mistaken when I gave them my ID). Let me digress a bit - there should have been mention that there was a facility fee at check in because I was not aware until I checked out. And even if I knew, it should have been courtesy because I was told that my reservation is all paid for and that they were only holding an incidental charge of $100 which will be released upon checkout - this was not the case. First hidden charge - that is a front desk training issue.Secondly, when we arrived to the room, while it was small, that was expected given the capsule hotel design. The room did optimize the space and I was a fan of the bed. However, we had no hot water and had to call for facilities to come by at midnight - I had called ahead and informed the property that we would be arriving late and they should have ensured the room was functioning before checking us in.Other issues that popped up during the stay - no curtain between the bathroom and the bedroom even though the tracks were on the ceiling. Leaking sink - we ended up stuffing towels underneath it. Mirror at the bathroom had electrical issues as it wouldn't turn on unless you tapped it a few times and finally the towel rack heater was not working and I had called to have this fixed and it never was looked at. Oh and we did not have a TV remote in the room and had to call three times for it to be sent up. Heads up: they charge you for luggage storage as well - which is usually a complimentary service for most full-service hotels.Overall, since we were out most of the day and stayed a short time, I didn't really care for the tits and tats, but they kept adding up which was annoying.","Hi,Thank you for your insightful feedback.

897,20,-20.0,30.0,16.0,9.0,30.0,-9.0,,,,,,,apologyMadereservationtost,enVision Hotel Boston - Longwood,30,"Made reservation to stay EIGHT nights during College Parent's weekend and take days before and after the weekend. This place was rec'd by a family member who stayed ONE night.Did not realize that it was a very tiny place in a rather bad section of Boston. Security not great- doorman absent often as is front desk:( ie. anyone can walk in); Ask basic questions to front desk personnel about transportation, local attractions, dining, discounts available, and got no help. Did not even offer to find out an answer. They have two cheap stationary ""iPads"" that have touch screens that are almost impossible to work. I was having difficulty working it and asked the front desk manager who was literally five feet away and he tried to show me with his finger and did not even get up to assist. The"" iPads"" do not print anything. If you want anything printed you have to send a document as an email to the front desk and they will try to do it. There is real no lobby. There is a VERY TINY closet sized space where you can purchase coffee and snacks, no milk.Room was fine,clean, bed comfortable. But, very strange appliances- did not recognize names ( close out sale?) and microwave hard to work. TV fine but clicker did not work at first, had to have them work on it. First two days room was not cleaned. Had to have them come up at night w new towels/toilettries. When you leave your room the door does NOT SHUT all the way-- it rests on the lock. You have to wait till it gets to the lock and then push it shut. If you walk out quickly you would never know it. This is a SECURITY ISSUE.Gym is in the basement level and must have just been painted and reeked of fumes, no windows. Again, weird brand name treadmill and stepper; Treadmill comes to a complete STOP when your times is up and there is no ""cool down"" and couldn't figure how to work it to add a few minutes for a cool down. When I left the gym, noticed the back door out to the street was OPEN and air blowing it back and forth. NOTE:The elevator to all the floors two steps from OPEN DOOR.Looked around outside for perhaps a worker --- no one, just eerie neighborhood. So I shut the door. Went upstairs to front desk... nobody.... Saw someone out front and asked if he is the front desk person, and yes he was. Told him my safety concerns and he did not believe me. Told me there is no way the door would be open. And, there are security cameras at the front desk anyway ( Where NOBODY WAS!)Told him I would show him if he would escort me to the basement. He continued jokingly to tell me I must not have seen it properly and that it shuts.So, we go down he opens the door with his slide key and he swings it open and tells me to ""Watch"" and we watch as it slowly almost shuts but two inches before the end-- it remains open. He then tells me he is strong and can protect me. JOKE JOKE. I told him that this is a major security concern and it is not a joking matter. He says don't worry.I immediately called the 800 number for Choice hotels and by this time the Guest services/complaints Dept was closed and reservations could do nothing. I called in the morning and spoke to Guest Services and they said they would talk to the manager.Next morning on my way out I spoke to FOUR people at front desk, all very early twenties, (naive) about the safety issue and they stared at me like I was CRAZY. One girl actually had to cover her mouth from laughing. One man about twentysomething yrs old, as seriously as he could muster, commented that yes it was a security issue and it was being addressed.This is when I reported that my NINE night stay was being changed as I did not consider the place safe, and I was checking out the next day. ( MONEY LOSS). The manager than asked :""Is there anything we can do to make your stay more comfortable?"" and, ""Was your stay enjoyable?"", I replied ""NO, it wasn't and it is a bit too late to do anything now, thank you!""Got back to room and there was a bag filled with treats from the pantry and a note that said thank you for staying with us. Very nice, but really what they need to do is GET TRAINED ON HOW TO BE A PROFESSIONAL. Take security issues seriously. Keep the front desk manned if you depend on security cameras at night. Get off the phone when a paying customer is standing there over five minutes at the desk waiting to speak to you. Put a new phone call on hold when you are in the middle of answering a question instead of taking the call that ends up being ten minutes while the customer (ME) is standing there waiting for the rest of what you were saying. Learn to find answers to questions instead of saying. ""Geez I don't really know', get off your butt and help customers when they have difficulty using the iPad, find out names of restaurants, find out local discounts that come with the Charlie Card, know when the ""T"" stops at the hotel and when it does not, find out if there is construction on ""T"" and routes are changed: BASIC THINGS customers expect from a supposedly ""Boutique Upscale Hotel"".Would never go back here again even though beds were great. I pay for more than beds.","We're sorry to hear that you were disappointed with your recent stay. Although I may have my opinion, I value yours and understand that you did not perceive the neighborhood to be safe. I can assure you that this is a very safe area and it will only improve in the years to come with new apartment and restaurant developments underway. To be honest, it is quite frustrating to hear these comments after I specifically went out of my way to ensure your satisfaction. It was not evident to me, or my fellow associates, that you were this unhappy with your experience. Not only is our desk always happy to help, but one associate specifically asking if you needed help with finding restaurants or travel directions and you declined. We offer the iPads as a unique business center option as space is limited in our lobby (as you mentioned). Most guests find them very easy to use and I‚Äôm sorry you were unable to print on them as they do print wirelessly to the front desk. I find it difficult to read the comments about our staff service as almost every guest makes a point to recognize how refreshing it is to find a cozy, affordable hotel that offers outstanding personalized service. Every staff member is personally selected and trained to go out of his or her way to assist all guests. I am glad that the comfort of our mattresses was the silver lining in your stay and I assure you that the in-room appliances are top notch in commercial options. I wish you the best in future travel plans and hope your family and friends back in the NJ area are safe and healthy.",Trip type: Traveled with friends,Date of stay: October 2012,"Response from Trevor C, General Manager at enVision Hotel Boston - Longwood","Responded Nov 5, 2012",288,51.33,92.75,44.3,86.13,24.0,16.67,92.71,55.56,19.1,13.89,4.51,2.08,5.56,0.69,1.04,5.21,4.86,13.89,7.99,3.47,7.64,1.04,14.58,8.68,3.82,0.35,0.35,1.39,7.64,5.56,2.08,0.0,0.35,1.39,15.62,0.35,2.08,0.35,0.69,13.54,2.43,1.04,1.74,4.17,3.12,3.12,1.39,0.0,0.69,0.0,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.69,9.03,4.86,2.08,2.08,0.35,1.39,2.78,10.42,2.08,12.5,2.43,8.68,2.43,4.17,2.08,1.74,0.69,0.0,0.0,0.0,0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,7.64,4.17,2.08,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.0,0.35,0.0,0.35,0.69,0.0,112.5,1.170912052117264,1.851042345276873,1.904267100977197,324.9948269472017,596.872883864324,4.556875000000001,2.48375,5.395,-0.07267340067340068,0.1753761312337494,0.2382043190908946,0.1993317334255147,0.2845965175536791,0.3118999701839818,-0.3643571428571427,0.3071937984496125,0.2661792158850546,0.2164880322323534,0.3414979639518009,0.4137333333333336,0.554504761904762,0.6848571428571426,0.03908794788273616,0.006514657980456026,0.00977198697068404,0.01954397394136808,0.05211726384364821,7,10.857142857142858,True,enVision

Our second night, the hotel decided to put a group of teenagers on all the rooms on our floor. They were very loud around midnight, talking loudly in the hall and slamming doors, running to each others rooms and talking. No adult supervision. I tried to call the front desk, but no one answered.I complained about the noise and the fact that the front desk did not answer the phone the next day. We had a two-year-old child with us and the hotel was aware. Later a letter from the manager was distributed stating that after 8:00 p.m. was quiet time. It was still noisy. The hotel never monitored the floor, knowing that there were issues. They did not enforce their own policy, no security present.The front desk did not answer the phone in the evenings. There was no ""mature"" presence at the front desk or anywhere in the hotel. Supposedly the manager was onsite one day, but I never saw the person,The last night there was extremely loud between 11:00 and midnight. It was ridiculous that this group of immature and inconsiderate teenagers ruined our stay at this hotel. One was outside our door in the hall talking on the phone at midnight.I saw a Trip Advisor seal of excellence at the front desk and was amazed. The room was small and not comfortable. The lobby area was small, few services at the hotel, no restaurant. I would not ever stay at this hotel again, nor would I ever recommend it to anyone.","Greetings Harpist77,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience and I do apologize for the inconveniences you experienced.
