Hotel Figueroa,10,"We were there for 4 long nights. Walls are paper thin so you can hear all neighbors. The smell of pot was overwhelming and the room 2 doors down also fighting 24/7 and smoking. My daughter was move to another room-with a leak in the hall. I continued to be entertained by the battles for the rest of my stay. The hotel is shabby, small and dark. Bathroom was horrid with a tiny tub, no water pressure and no makeup mirror. Half the sockets had no electricity. Front desk was staffed by several sweet young women, but security could not resolve the issues. Tiny pool and hard to get swim times. No breakfast despite that it was supposed to be included.","Dear jmcneil771,This is simply disappointing, and I'm so sorry for your experience.

Hotel Figueroa,30,"All in all I thought the Figueroa was a cute hotel, and the pool was especially relaxing. Through no fault of the individual staff I spoke to, however, there were multiple issues throughout our stay that made our experience a bit underwhelming which I'm sure were exacerbated by working under COVID.We had booked the Classic Suite as there was an advertised desk, from which we were planning to work on Friday. When we got there, we found out ours was the only Suite without a desk (listed in fine print on the website, turns out so that's partially on us). They did reach out on Saturday to give us a new room, but by then it was no longer needed.Our TV was also not working on Friday night. While they were able to have someone come fix it in the morning and he was, again, very nice, it was a bit disappointing to have one of three nights with a major amenity not working. Our coffee machine also didn't work and again, it got replaced, but it did leave us with the feeling of everything in our room being a bit of a struggle.They're also booking the pool by two hours time slots after 11AM each day which makes total sense due to COVID. The pool was lovely and I felt very safe there, but on our second day, we were told the front desk had double booked the slots so it wasn't actually available. The man handling the pool gave us free drink coupons and told us we could sit elsewhere but with the pool being a major draw this could have easily been a huge disappointment. Thankfully, another family left early so we grabbed our chairs. Once settled, the pool was great and the poolside food/drink service was lovely.All in all, the hotel was nice, pool was great, restaurant fare was tasty, staff were super friendly, just the amount of small things that went wrong left a bit more to be desired.","Dear Alexandra S,Appreciate your feedback! Our commitment to maintaining a safe and relaxing environment shouldn't make us overlook details like that. We appreciate your understanding, but I'm very sorry for these oversights. Your room should have been perfect for you, and we really hope you'll give us the chance to make this right next time you're in DTLA.Warm regards,Connie",,Date of stay: October 2020,"Response from Connie Wang, General Manager at Hotel Figueroa",Responded 1 week ago
Hotel Figueroa,30,"Wanted to love work perks so I could justify doing it again and again BUT the service was hugely disappointing. Had to wait a while to check in town get my reserved seat at the pool.was already a tad rigid about being able to use pool and to top it off staff was t there.Tried calling down from my room and nobody answered. And other staff didn’t seem to know the food, or lack of food situation.Place is beautiful!","Dear Safari696348,So sorry we let you down. We're dedicated to maintaining a safe environment for all our guests, so we appreciate your patience and understanding at the pool. We definitely should have promptly picked up the phone and been able to clearly communicate about the available menu though. I apologize for that and have addressed this with the team. We understand being able to safely work away from home is especially important right now, and we'd love to have the chance to have you back for a better experience soon!Sincerely,Connie",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: October 2020,"Response from Connie Wang, General Manager at Hotel Figueroa",Responded 1 week ago
Hotel Figueroa,20,Booked a one night staycation for my anniversary. Paid for deluxe king room that was extremely average I cannot imagine what the classic rooms are. We were put in an adjoining room and the other adjoining room smoked a ton of weed that infiltrated our room all night. Mini fridge didn’t work. Pool looked amazing online and was supposed to be only for hotel guests but was obviously filled with random people just walking in from the front of the veranda restaurant street entrance with no Covid restrictions or regulations. Also apparently you have to reserve pool spots which no one told us at all so there were absolutely no spots to even use the pool. Wanted a nice staycation for a special occasion but felt way cheaper and way different than advertised. Rooms a lot different from pictures. Very disappointed.,"Dear Mel9519,Thank you sincerely for staying with us, and please accept my sincere apologies that your stay fell far short of your expectations and ours. Please reach out to me directly at cwang@hotelfigueroa.com so that I can personally make things right. Your anniversary is important to us, and that trust is not misplaced. As a historic hotel, we have a wide variety of room configurations, and I am confident we can find the right one for you.Due to our COVID-related safety procedures, we have removed a significant amount of seating at the pool to ensure that our guests are socially distanced. Beginning this weekend, the hotel will be opening Ricks, our lovely pool house, for additional 6' distanced seating/lounging during our peak times. We will continue to take reservations at the front desk for safety reasons. Between guest reservations, our pool team sanitizes and refreshes each seating area so that you have peace of mind.Stay safe and I look forward to connecting.

Hotel Figueroa,20,I stayed here for work and was not pleased with the hotel. The rooms are very small and there was barely any room to fit my luggage. There was no desk space to do any work. The bathroom was incredibly small and there wasn’t even room on the sink to put toiletries or makeup bag. The smell in the hotel was dingy and the service at reception and all dining areas was less than ideal. Ordered breakfast from the restaurant one morning and the food came out cold and yucky. I would not recommend this hotel.,"Dear Fortunecookie127,I do regret you had a very unsatisfactory stay with us at Hotel Figueroa. It seems we missed the mark throughout your stay. As you mentioned, we do have some select rooms that are small in design. The majority of the hotel rooms do offer large bathrooms and full closets for our guests to store their belongings. I will be looking into the odor you mentioned and following up with our front office and food & beverage teams to share your sentiments, so we can continue to offer elevated service across the hotel.In attempts to recover your negative experience, I have sent you a direct message so we can get in contact.

Hotel Figueroa,20,"The room is very small. Even with one double bed. The bathroom is tiny with a tub and the vanity provides no space for toiletries. The room is very noisy with both street noise and room to room noise and the corridor as well. There are multiple flashing lights in the room that are annoying. The desk is not functional. It’s part dresser and part desk, is mounted too high on the wall to work at comfortably with the desk chair that is not a desk chair and then the tv comes pretty far off the wall and is right in your face. It’s very dark at night. The view is bad. The finishes are nice enough, but don’t come close to compensating for the other deficiencies. The service is not great and the restaurant is a disappointment.","Dear theodores246,I do regret you found your overall stay to be less than satisfactory.

Hotel Figueroa,10,"Wow. We waited for an hour for our room. Our first room's bed smelt like rancid body odor. We were moved to a 2nd room without any reparations and the remote for the TV was missing. Side note, the elevators take forever, seriously, plan to add an additional 10-15 mins travel time whenever you plan on leaving the hotel.It's a shame, the hotel has a good downtown location and is nicely decorated however I would not recommend Hotel Figurora.","Dear Will_Byrnes,Let me start by massively apologizing for the room conditions you found upon arrival. This is certainly not reflective of the high cleaning standards we hold for ourselves. Each room is meticulously inspected and I regret your room was found otherwise. Whilst we do have two guest elevators that service the hotel, there are some demand times with arrivals and departures that can delay usage.

Hotel Figueroa,30,"Really great hotel and nice historical atmosphere, didn't even know that breakfast was included in price, probably not many visitors knew as there was really quiet at breakfast room at mornings.Stayed there with my friend for 7 days, we didn't fit hotels shape of their average visitors I guess as different days I didn't got answer for my good morning/good day comments, just long looks by receptionists. Well, I'm used to that, but I always wonder why is that, we are paying customers after all.Rooms AC control seemed to have mind of his own, but after few nights we managed to live with that also. :)After all great hotel, with safe location near Staples center.

Hotel Figueroa,30,"This is a charming hotel and well located. However, my room had no desk and I had to take a side table and move it adjacent to a chair in order to have a place to work, leaving the coffee maker on the floor. Since this was a conference hotel, I was quite surprised that there was no desk, which I would have thought was standard. On a better note, the breakfast was great but I didn't know about it until day 3 since they never told me at check in.","Dear sron333,Thank you for you recent stay at Hotel Figueroa and taking the time to leave us feedback.

Hotel Figueroa,30,"Start with the positives: The hotel is beautiful. Has a wonderful history, and the public spaces are very nice. There was a great band doing soul covers of 2000s hits on one of the nights I was there, and it was a hopping crowd for an early show that closed down early enough for everyone to sleep. Attractive, diverse clientele for events, I imagine 30-somethings will really enjoy the public experience at the hotel. The staff is very friendly and the front desk and door experience is great.On the negatives: Service on a Monday was slow. The down pillows in the room were absolutely terrible (limp and unsupportive), and so I asked for two foam pillows. An hour and a half later, still no pillows. I called again and they had obviously lost my order, to their credit they got those pillows to me right away after the second call. Unfortunately, they were the worst foam pillows I have ever received at a hotel. Small, ""memory foam"" contour pillows that were extremely hard, not much give at all. I'm particular about my pillows, but really this was below par for any hotel that I have stayed at, and this is an expensive hotel.My biggest issue was that the A/C vent is pointed directly at the head of the vent (I was in a 12th-floor room with vaulted ceilings, this may be specific to this room type). It was very uncomfortable having air blown on my face all night (it was hot in LA). Eventually I figured out I could open the window at night to cool the room but that opened me up to outside noise -- but I used a sleep app to combat that. The shower fixtures were weak and unsatisfying ""Sunflower"" types.Breakfast is fairly weak. All I would end up eating was the yogurt and granola. The line for the toaster was ridiculous -- and I wasn't the only one frustrated. People were fighting for the toaster, I gave up quickly because I don't need that kind of stress in the morning.Finally -- I filled out an online survey as part of my stay at the hotel, which elaborated on most of these points. It was a fairly negative review on the first night of a 4-night stay. Nobody reached out to me to discuss the issues, and then I got this request for a TripAdvisor review. Normally I wouldn't bother to complain publicly, but since my initial review was ignored and I'm still being bombarded with bots to complete a public review, I thought it was my duty to complete it. Perhaps this could encourage the hotel to consider how they engage in digital customer service.","Dear msyp2019,I want to start my immensely apologizing for the overall experience of your stay.

The hotel itself was very nice, looks like it was upgraded recently. But, my room had no refrigerator, others said theirs had one. I was told on the last day, I could have asked for one. Really? But, the facilities overall are very nice, however the ""gym""... I have to put that in quotes as its is soooo tiny. 2 treadmills, 1 elliptical, a set of weights, some yoga mats, and a strength-training device. I would rather them give me a pass to a real gym. In general, the hotel was clean, but on a couple occasions, a plate of food was left outside of one of the rooms near my room, all day.

Hotel Figueroa,10,"I'm really not sure why everyone has raved about this hotel, as our experience was underwhelming and quite frankly very disappointing. Upon arrival I was blown away by the interior and decor, but that was the only part of our stay that I enjoyed. We booked the corner suite for two nights. The bedroom duvet was covered in a coffee like stain and dirty like it hadn’t been changed from the last guest. After speaking to front desk, they apologised and said they would send someone up right away to change the duvet and sheets, and offered us a complimentary drink in the bar while this was done. This was a really nice gesture. Now the bar service was something else though. I have never come across a barman so rude and miserable it made us feel uncomfortable. The gent that served us was in the worst mood, and not only got our drinks order incorrect three times, he tried to charge us for all the incorrect drinks we apparently ordered. His tone and chat were rather appalling even after trying to have a little joke with him to lighten the mood. He said to us ‘I’m not having a bad day, it’s the restaurants fault for always changing the menu’. Five star customer service right there! Any who after our cocktails (and bottle of wine) we proceeded up to the room to find that housekeeping hadn’t been up to change the bedding. Not overly impressed considering we had been out of the room for over an hour and half. We decided to go out for dinner in the hopes that by the time we got back everything would be ready. We got back to the room at about 10pm to find that the duvet cover had been completely removed and replaced with just a sheet. Called front desk again, this time someone came up within 15 minutes but handed us a duvet and went to walk off. My partner was quick to ask that they make the bed.We were out the entire following day, and didn’t arrive back to our room until after midnight to find yet again just a sheet on our bed. We were too tired to say anything this time, but were extremely annoyed at the service we had received through-out our stay. Upon check out, the front desk attendant asked how our stay was and I was very honest. The only redeemable factor in our stay is that front desk were very apologetic and waived the ‘resort fee’ from our stay – which after almost a week later we are still yet to receive the refund for. I was hoping the initial issues we had were just a one off, but to receive bad service over two days tells me that customer service is not the forefront for this hotel especially for non-business guests. Just goes to show that a hotel can look beautiful from the outside but if the service is terrible then it is a one star in my mind. I will never stay here again, and I will never recommend this hotel to anyone simply because of the poor service we received.","Dear Bree S,Please let me start by immensely apologizing for the challenges you experienced during your stay. The service you received at the bar is absolutely unacceptable and I want to assure this was addressed immediately, with action. Housekeeping management have been shared your feedback and further internal training has taken place to ensure instances like this, do not happen again.

The room was on the small side, but the beds were very comfortable and they provided us a crib, microwave and refrigerator upon request.

The shower was amazing and the proximity to the Convention Center, L.A. Live, and the Microsoft Theater was perfect.

Hotel Figueroa,30,"First of all, let me begin by saying I am an easy-going person who enjoys all kinds of experiences- so I am just going to write the facts. I arrived on Friday night at 9:30 pm to the hotel. Upon walking into the checking area, there was a strong smell of marijuana. I made a joke at the front desk that “ I thought I had left Portlabd, Oregon”! I don’t mind the smell- but I don’t think all guests would feel the same. All the front desk people chuckled and were nice.I got into my room, and I liked that the lights came on automatically. The hotel has been remodeled. It seems like I was put in a handicapped room as there were bars located through the bathroom around the toilet and in the shower. I was wondering why I was put in a handicapped room... There is no refrigerator and I was disappointed since I had sandwiches to refrigerate. Even low end hotels have refrigerators! I also noticed there were no towel racks to hang towels after use. Strange. Also no hairdryer. I have long, thick hair that takes 8 hours to dry without a hairdryer- needless to say- I did not wash my hair. The bed was comfortable, even though it was soft. The pillows and comforter were comfortable. Best pillows ever! Room temperature was good. Traffic noise from Figueroa St was loud and music. This did not bother me as I am a sound sleeper.First morning - I took a shower, but the hot water was only tepid so I shivered through it. I told Ray at the front desk and he was kind and said it was an easy fix and would be fixed during the day.I went to the continental breakfast at 6:30 am and the workers were nice and friendly. There was a variety of tasty food and beverages. Much more than the usual continental breakfast.I returned that evening at 10 pm. I was really tired due to being in a 14 hour program of meditation where I walked barefoot. I just wanted to wash my feet and go to bed. I turned on the water in the shower and it was scalding hot in all directions! Yikes! Apparently they did not check the water temperature when they readjusted. I called the front desk to let them know, and Ray volunteered a different room, but I was so tired, I just wanted to fall into my bed and sleep, not repack and move.Sunday morning I decided to see what was going on with the water temp. I saw that it was stuck in a limited position, so with some wiggling and strength, I was able to loosen the dual to reach all water temperatures, and could take a shower finally!I came back from my conference at 4 pm on Sunday and wanted to rest. I noticed that hospitality had not been in. I called the front desk to ask why, and they said that room can be cleaned up to 5 pm. I had gotten up at 3:30 am that day, and needed to take a nap, so I told them to cancel cleaning. I was napping, and housekeeping walked in and woke me. I asked her to leave.I could not go back to sleep, so I decided to go down to the restaurant. First I went to the Veranda, but music was blasting at the pool which was too noisy for me, so I chose the other restaurant. I am a vegetarian, so I ordered a dish with lentils, smoked potatoes and mushrooms. It was tasty , but misrepresented on the menu. The potatoes were not smoked , just cooked in a pot as the server explained. The server was really nice and comped that meal.Ok- Monday- checkout day. Breakfast is supposed to start at 6:30 am. I arrive at 6:45 am. Breakfast was not even remotely ready. What a mess! The employees’ faces were all unhappy! Wow! Little by little food was brought out: oatmeal left open for 6 minutes without any intensifs to serve it; bread and bagels brought out, but no butter. When butter, jam and cream cheese were brought out, no serving utensils; no tableware to eat the food until 7 am, no hot water for tea etc. I could continue... all food was brought out by 7:10am. I needed to leave for airport at 7:30 am. At 7:10 am, the food and beverage director came to my table to apologize for the “mess”, brought a menu and offered me food from the regular restaurant. I could not take advantage of this since I needed to check out.At checkout, I was offered a discount of the extra $25 per day room charge. They said that they could not do better than that since I paid in advance via a 3 rd party site.What a strange visit! Most of the staff were friendlyand nice.Recommendations for the hotel: supply hairdryers, refrigerators.I will not stay here again!","Dear elf369,Thank you for taking the time to review our hotel.

Hotel Figueroa,10,"Got my belongings stolen right at the front door after letting it there for a moment while I went to talk to the concierge. So when I looked behind and realized that my stuff was gone, I told to the black male concierge. He did not cared at all, and he was rude, unprofessional when I asked for the security man to look at the cameras. He told me that the security guard was busy doing more important things and that I needed to wait 30 minutes. I asked to the parking oversee, a young latino who is always inside of his booth, that is very close to the front door, but he was blasé and not proactive at all. After half-hour I asked the silly concierge if the security person was already taking care of my case looking at the footage, and he told me almost yelling at me ""I told you to wait, I told you it would be long because he is busy"". After one long hour, the security man came and told me that I needed to fill a report. That is it, I got stolen right when I arrive the ""fancy hotel"", and none of the employee give importance to that unacceptable situation. If I was a very rich or famous person, or even the owner, they would be more sympathetic and helpful. I hope the hotel train their employee better, to treat the guests as human beings because it seemed that I was doing the staff a favor, when it was supposed to be the opposite, they should do me the favor of being aidful.","Dear marcosladarens,Let me start by immensely apologizing for what has happened to you.

Hotel Figueroa,20,"You expect when you book at a premier hotelier like World Destinations that it would be good but from the very start, it was less than acceptable. The valet and check-in in less than appealing. Immediately when you walk in the door with little room to maneuver to get in. Service was subpar at best, they didn't have the reservation and I had to wait for them to call corporate so long I decided to venture to the bar. The property is an architectural masterpiece with such beautiful history and character. I sat at the bar waiting for the front desk to retrieve me thinking I might have a drink to soften the dissatisfaction only to never be approached by the bartender and I continued to wait while he muddled a drink for the other 2 people that were already at the bar. After 10 minutes of sitting idly waiting for him (still no acknowledgement ) the bellhop that I had instructed to retrieve me when the front desk figured it out arrived. No drink. HORRIBLE customer service. Why an establishment would employ someone without the basic skills necessary to work in such a position is shameful. The room was ok. Bathroom was small with little sink space but pleasantly designed. Everything about the room was sufficient but unimpressive. This property lacks the sophistication to ensure the quality of a diamond level property should be. I would not recommend unless your interest is in historical architecture and if so then I might suggest trying the restaurant although the breakfast of toast, oats, and fruit stations spread along the bar in the morning was also uninspiring.","Dear 545ricd,Thank you for taking the time to provide us, as well as your fellow travelers, with this thoughtful feedback regarding your recent stay.

Hotel Figueroa,10,"The Figueroa is a try hard boutique impersonator whose shallow aesthetic is reflected in its poor service delivery, dingy rooms, and overpriced parking!Sure, it's a nice building and on the surface the finish is of high quality, this superficiality soon becomes annoying as basic conventions of hospitality are ignored on some seemingly misguided stylistic whim to be ‘authentic whilst frivolous details of supposed brand identity (like the proudly displayed vibrator laden sex kit as a mini bar option) are religiously adhered to. For example, my room was lacking a ceiling light which being overlooked, required the constant use of the blackout blind (there was no net option) rendering the room draped in a depressing gloam from the table lamp even during the day. The room was tiny and the bed was dumped in a frame four of five inches too wide providing both a handy space for losing wallets, keys, phones etc. and giving the illusion of the bed being much larger than it actually is and usurping much needed room space at the same time! There appears to have been an architectural commitment to making the dingy room as noisy as possible with street noise coming in through the window and the grunts, groans and gaseous emissions of other guests coming through the paper thin walls and air vents – most of whom seem to have availed themselves of the aforementioned sex kit judging by the nature of the noises!It would be difficult to overcome these shortcomings with top notch service and it is perhaps why no attempt at such a provision was made! In fact the one thing the Figueroa excelled in was rude, arrogant, inflexible and incompetent staff. The Figueroa seems to pride itself on cultivating nice bars and with partial success (although the bars were dead on the Friday I checked in). Note that a lot of positive reviews of this establishment are for the bar and not the hotel. In short, the Figueroa’s self-conscious attempt at arty chic individuality is hackneyed and falls short of the effortless avant garde feel which other boutique offerings have long since mastered. All fur coats and no knickers as my dear grandmother would have said.",I am so terribly sorry that your stay did not meet your expectations.

Hotel Figueroa,20,"I was here for a conference for 2 nights, that was probably about 1 night too long. This is a small old hotel in the downtown area. My room was extremely dark and tiny. It felt like they made a room out of what was originally a maid's closet near the elevator. This was the smallest and darkest hotel room I have ever stayed in. Think of a typical Manhattan hotel room and now divide that space in half and remove most of the lights, that was my room. I asked if there was another room available but they were sold out. The iron was not working... when I called down to the desk the young woman who answered simply said they'd send another one up, no apology. Thankfully I was the only person staying in the room, I cannot imagine how 2 people could fit in that little space with luggage. Lunch at the hotel was disappointing, a sad dry unimaginative salad with a soft drink, $30.

Hotel Figueroa,30,"This was a super frustrating experience. My husband and I came to town for a basketball game at staples and heard this place recently went though a renovation. Since we heard good things and the location was perfect for us we decided to stay even though it’s extremely overpriced. We paid 440 for a room which we wouldn’t have minded if the service was good. First off the front desk is understaffed, super slow, and seemingly unorganized.Then we had to wait between 10-15 minutes each time for the elevator because one was broken. We were on 10th floor so not super easy to take the stairs. The elevator experience for us and all the other guests was just super ridiculous and in over 24hours we saw no one even attempting to fix it, just a sign saying out of order.When we arrived we had drinks in the bar. Drinks and bar bites were decent and the bartenders were friendly but looked stressed, seemed understaffed. But we were informed the bar closes at 11pm which is super early, especially for downtown LA on a Friday night.The next morning while trying to get brunch the answer at 3 out of 3 places in the hotel was no. So bizarre. Went the the restaurant by the pool and was plenty of open tables and 5-6 open seats at the bar and the hostess told us they were at capacity. RidiculousThen we went to check out and retrieve our luggage and we complained about how irritating the whole stay was. The manager gave us a $150 credit towards our stay which was nice but doesn’t change the fact the whole experience was sub par. It took two asks and over 20 minutes to get our luggage from behind the desk. There were other people in the lobby all giving each other looks like this place is crazy type thing. Basically the service overall was terrible !!!!!The only reason that I’m not giving a 1 star is that the beds were comfortable and the nice man at the front desk apologized for our experience and tried to help the situation by giving us a credit.And beware! Valet is $50 !!I’d say stay somewhere else,","I am so terribly sorry for the problems you experienced during your stay. I can assure you that our guests satisfaction is most important to us.

Let's start with a Lyft arrival on a busy downtown street, but no worries because the spacious hotel parking lot is right next door. The crowded reception area with room for seemingly 2 staff had 4-5 bustling crew getting luggage and rooms settled in a flash (checkout was surprisingly crowded but fast as well).Room 809 was tiny with a comfy double bed but no desk to work at and no room to set out two suitcases. No lightswitch at entrance and had to feel around in the dark to turn on bathroom light, then find the single desk lamp. For a newly remodeled hotel, why just one lamp for the whole bedroom?Bathroom door was beautiful frosted glass, but downside was using the RR in middle of night or early morning shined bright light into sleeping area.Bathroom had no place to hang bath towels or clothes.Cool iPad clock/alarm didn't dock well and ran out of power day 2.Noise from hallway conversations and elevator ding dings means I should have brought ear plugs.First floor dining room and lounge is lovely and food and service was great.Overall the staff was excellent and made you feel welcomed.

Hotel Figueroa,30,"What's good: THE LOOK - a fun mix of contemporary and old Hollywood/California Mission /Moorish style with a spectacular lounge/lobby/restaurant space and pool/bar area. Gorgeous furnishings, light fixtures and an assortment of vibrant work by LA based artists. LOCATION - great for all DTLA museums and the concert hall, near to USC, the convention center etc, & within walking distance of good restaurants (and even a Ralph's market) FRIENDLY RECEPTION STAFF - pleasant, welcoming and eager to help. BEDS very comfy with soft sheets and good pillows. COMPLIMENTARY SNACKS/WATER - basket filled with cookies, pretzels, chips, candy, kettle corn and yes! water in a carton (please wake up world to this idea) BOOKS - wonderfully generous assortment of art/photography books in the lobby and LA authored paperbacks in the rooms.What's not so good: RESTAURANT/BAR SERVICE - staff overwhelmed and offered no eye contact or greeting (in huge contrast to the reception area) we had trouble ordering coffee in the morning and a drink in the evening (though while waiting in vain got to watch some extravagant cocktail making involving foot-long spoons, giant goblets, herbs, berries and magical vapour) ROOM SERVICE - errrrr, we tried but the iPad (provided in the room) method was non-functioning and the menu (no hard copy) was limited and surprisingly unappealing (room service doesn't need to reflect the chef - sometimes you just want a club sandwich or a chopped salad, you know?) THE BATHROOM - pretty tiles and hardware but no towel rails and only one hook on the wall (for bathrobe? for towel? forced to choose) a shower big enough for a crowd but no bathtub (sigh) BEDROOM LIGHTING - by bed okay but dim/nonexistent by the furniture (thus impossible to read the books provided.)

Hotel Figueroa,30,"Disclosure: This hotel review is for the service at the Veranda for Sunday brunch.First off, the hotel is beautiful, super scenic and posh...not really my scene/style as I am not an over the top Angelino but I digress.My friend and I went for brunch and the service would make a snail sneer. The bartender seemed to be super frazzled and the place was just getting started, she was so slow and appeared to be stressed out, I overheard her tell a coworker that a guy who closed his tab did not leave a tip, I completely understand why he didn't.Brunch portions were small and the drinks are quite pricey. We paid roughly 16.00 for each cocktail and we had quite a few.Our server was very apologetic as he understood the bartender was in over her head, he made sure our water was always full and was very nice.Perhaps it was an off day but brunch is a big deal in L.A., that paired with a large crowd and one stressed bartender was less than pleasant.Nice hotel groundsno drink specialsprobably won't go back5 stars for the ambiance, less two for the service","Thank you so much for the feedback. I apologize that your experience at the Veranda was less than enjoyable during our Sunday brunch.

Hotel Figueroa,10,"I usually stay at the Four Seasons when in LA, but my niece recommended to stay here. Big mistake, the room was small, had almost no closet space, the bathroom appears to be under construction, there is no place to hang towels, no place to put the soap, the toilet is broken or misplaced, the bathroom tiles are broken, the walk finishes, have not been finished. Spoke to the manager, Andrew, and showed him personally the condition of the room, which he calls a Superior Queen something. Another place to avoid, if you want to have a good time in LA and if you want a comfortable room with a finished bathroom.

Ocean View Hotel,20,"The hotel position was fabulous however that's where fabulous ends. When we checked in the receptionist tried to charge us 44 USD per night for parking when we were given a price of 35 USD per night at point of booking the rooms severals weeks earlier. He photo copied my confirmation and eventually honoured the 35 USD rate. We were then given an electronic room card for what was suppose to be our room but it would not work after several attempts and calling room service she advised us that the room was being used by other guests. So back to reception to be given another card for the room next to the first one. The room had no view but was clean, furnishings were nice but nothing more than we expected at 522.60 USD for two nights (£418 GBP). We came back to our room on the second day at 3pm to find our room had not been cleaned but a glass we used had been taken away and replaced. I phoned reception who advised me mini bar dept had been in but was sorry room service had not been yet and he would send someone up. I ask him to leave it for an hour as we were in to freshen up before going for dinner but around 4pm would be good. We arrived back after dinner and drinks around 9pm to find it still had not been done. I called reception again, they sent a chap up with about 4 fresh towels he took the dirty towels and the rubbish away, however we had to make our own bed and the room was not cleaned that day. On checking out I advised the receptionist of all the problems we had encountered and also advised her that our account should be paid in full except for the parking at 35 USD per night plus taxes. She apologised profusely and said we were very calm given all the problems especially the room not being cleaned, much calmer than she would have been. She then said let me take care of those parking charges for you and also said she was putting a 150 usd credit on our room account which would be credited to the card we used to pay the card a few months in advance. I clarified with her that she was wiping the parking charges and issuing the 150 usd credit which she confirmed, i was happy with that as it equated to almost one night free which I thought was the minimum they should have offered. However when we returned home we found both days parking plus tax (77usd) had in fact been charged and there was an additional charge for 2 times Hotel destination fee plus 14% city Occupancy tax amounting to 34.20 usd. So the 150 usd credit which was issued actually only amounted to 38.80 usd once the parking which was suppose to be wiped was deducted along with this Hotel destination fee and city tax which we were not made aware of was still outstanding or even existed. The right hand did not know what the left was doing in this hotel, very very unorganised. I was sent a survey on my recent visit to the hotel and completed it as above, I have also followed the completed survey up with several emails but no one from this establishment even had the common courtesy to reply to my concerns and issues. I THINK YOU CAN SAFELY SAY I WILL UNDER NO CIRCUMSTANCES BE REVISITING THIS HOTEL!!!!","Dear JW,I apologize that we did not meet your expectations and feel short of our service standards.

Ocean View Hotel,20,"We spent the last month travelling around the US and stayed in so many lovely hotels. This was one of the worst in terms of value for money. Rooms aren’t available until 4pm, and if the people before you get a late check out, it means right on 4pm despite waiting in the lobby and telling them you would be there earlier. Poor form on the hotel’s behalf. We left early too and the customer service wasn’t great. With taxes, we paid $500 USD inc parking so WATCH THE EXTRA TAXES!! The rooms are small, walls thin and rooms noisy. The double beds are also tiny. Very disappointing especially after reading the reviews. Would not recommend this hotel and we will not be back. What a rip off, the multitude of other hotels we stayed at for far less in LA were far better in all respects. The only good thing about the hotel was how nice the parking attendants were.","Dear BeachGirl997,Thank you for taking the time to give your feedback. I apologize that your stay was not up to your expectations and I understand how frustrating that can be. I appreciate that you brought up a few points so that I can clarify for others that may be looking for hotels in Santa Monica.Our check in time is 4pm and we sell out most of the nights. Because our hotel stays full most of the rooms for arrival are going to be ready around 4pm. The city tax rate on all Santa Monica hotels is about 15% of the room rate. We do charge additionally for parking at $40 per night. All hotels in Santa Monica charge for parking and our rates are reasonable for the area. The hotel has a $15 per night destination fee that includes the amenities of the hotel such as complimentary bottled water, bike rentals, cookies in the afternoon, high speed internet access and more. We provide all of this information at the time of booking and on our confirmation letters in the hope that guest know what to expect when they travel to the area.Thank you for the kind words about the valet team. I will make sure to recognize them for their effort. I am sorry to hear that you will not be returning.

Ocean View Hotel,20,It was our first time staying at The Ocean View hotel. The location is amazing but the hotel itself is a bit dated. The room itself is ok but the bathroom is very bare bones. What made our stay so disappointing is how they treated my family. My baby woke up a few times in the minute of night crying for about a minute at a time since he was not feeling well and when we went downstairs the front staff rudely told us verbatim that “the rooms on both sides could not sleep all night cause my baby was crying and that I needed to do something about it to keep him from disturbing the guests”. I found it so disgusting that they would treat us like that and try to shame us for something that’s completely out of our control. They never apologized to us for the treatment and the manager wouldn’t even look at me when we went to the front desk to check out. The only person who remotely treated us nicely was Joy but the service truly sucked here. If this hotel does not want children staying here they should make this an adult exclusive hotel or better insulate their walls. This place truly should be ashamed of how they treat their guests. We checked out four days early and the Fairmont treated us so much better.,"I am very sorry to hear about this experience. We never want any guest to feel the way that you were made to feel, especially when you have the health of your child to worry about. We will use this as a lesson to improve on our guest relations and train to be better overall so that in the future we do not have an incident like this again.

Ocean View Hotel,30,No question about it that this hotel is in an awesome location. The view from the room is what makes this hotel and the location to everything which couldn’t be better. The beds are definitely as advertised as “double” beds and be prepared if more than one person is attempting to sleep as they are very very SMALL. Rooms and balcony configuration is also on the small size. The issue that annoyed my entire family was the fact that the WIFI provided was extremely slow unless you paid for high speed internet yourself.

Ocean View Hotel,30,"Okay so let’s start with the positives. The location was fantastic, right near the pier and with heaps of great restaurants in close proximity.The foyer of the hotel is lovely and has a nice boutique feel about it. We didn’t have an ocean view and didn’t use the balcony at all. The room was fine but nothing special. Guessing the price was for the location not the room.The hotel doesn’t have a restaurant or room service. I was traveling with two boys 9 and 11 and room service is something we use particularly when they get sick or when they are super tired after sightseeing. I wouldn’t normally book somewhere without it (good lesson).There were constant issues with the lifts when we were there. It was also during the time of the bad Cali fires which didn’t add to my memory of this trip.I had issues with someone trying to get into my room. It may have been a mistake but when I called out I saw a person running down the hallway. I reported this to the front desk. This added to my not feeling particularly safe in the hotel.Didn’t have a pool but that wasn’t an issue for us as we didn’t stay there for that. Staff were generally helpful and would answer questions.The homeless issue at Santa Monica is pretty confronting (for an australian). The park along the beach is filled with homeless people which added to it not feeling safe particularly of a night.Bottom line this was an okay hotel in an amazing location.","Thank you so much for taking the time to review us and provide feedback.

Ocean View Hotel,30,"All of the staff members were exceptionally courteous and helpful. However, the hotel was lacking the little things. Daylight savings time had occurred three nights before our arrival and the clock was still wrong. We stayed there for three days and the ice machine on our floor was never fixed. For that same three days one of the two elevators did not work as it was “being repaired”. For that same 3 days the toilet paper holder was broken. The shower was one of the worst ever. I am all in favor of a “green“ hotel. However, the pressure in the showerhead was less than a spray bottle. When you combine the weak water pressure with the “rain shower” head coming down vertically from the ceiling you end up with a pretty miserable shower experience. The bed and pillows were quite comfortable. Wish we could say the same about the furnishings. The upholstered chair as well as the desk chair were quite uncomfortable.

Ocean View Hotel,20,"Our stay was rather disappointing in this extremely overpriced hotel. Parking was $40 per night (with in and out privileges, but that comes with tipping each time in and then out). We had a guest joining us and asked if they could park in the lot and it was ""yes, $10"", this was at 4:30. When we came down from our room at 5:30 to pay for the parking, it had now jumped to $15 ! Why? The availability of spaces we were told. Really???? Upon our arrival at 3:20 pm (after driving California highways for about 2 1/2 hours) we were told that our room was not ready and could only be accessed at 4:00. Again, Really???? This is truly the only hotel I have been to in many years that did not have a guest room ready significantly earlier than the ""check in time"". We were exhausted and wanted to freshen up but had no choice. Although we were given access to the first floor toilet facilities, there were no towels to dry our face and no toilet paper !!! We told the front desk staff and they had to call to get someone to deliver it. That took 10 minutes. Once we went to our room we found it rather musty. The view was lovely out over the ocean but the balcony was very small. It was difficult for both of us to be out on it along with the two chairs and small table. Not extremely comfortable. The bathroom was pretty but the shower water stream was VERY weak, the visible galvanized pipes under the sink unattractive and the painted door jam inside the bathroom was dirty and fingerprinted, poor cleaning job. We had pre-paid for the room, or so we thought. We checked out and found an additional $65 dollars tacked onto our bill - these were for all sorts of taxes and fees. What a sham !!! Definitely not worth the money, especially as there are no facilities anywhere on the property.

Ocean View Hotel,30,"I have never stayed here (or in Santa Monica) before. This is a nice hotel across the street from the ocean. There may be rooms with an ocean view but mine didn't have it. My room looked out on the parking courtyard which is where many of the rooms face. When I entered, the windows were open which was nice because of the fresh ocean air. Trash pickup or some commercial equipment was in the parking lot at 7:30 am the next morning and backing up with that annoying klaxon. They started power-washing the parking area not long after that. I was up before this started but if you want to sleep in, I would suggest you close the windows at night. The room was very nice. The front desk was staffed with one person who seemed nice and more interested in the computer screen in front of them than the customer.

It’s central location is brilliant for shops, bars, and restaurants in the city area.The room was clean and spacious and has all the modern requirements for the visitor. The internet is easily accessed and has a reasonable speed. The room view overlooked the beech but also the main drag which meant the traffic and reveller noise was a little higher than I would like but did not spoil our nights sleep. Good bed, warm room very comfortable.So why three stars your asking?On arrival the safe had to changed as it did not work. The hairdryer point in the bathroom did not work and for good measure the iPad charger points did not work. The hotel put the issues right but it took time. In compensation we were given a modest refund. My question is why so much wrong? Do other guests not use these things?The balcony was so small it felt like a ledge with two dirty chairs and tables it was useless.The front lounge consist of two filthy sofas that need burning!The other question is why does it cost so much? More than a 4x in Central London, with no pool, no restaurant no meaningful lounge to wait in. No guest showers for those who have to vacate and fly late.

The refrigerator in the room is fully stocked although the stuff is overpriced, which is to be expected anyway.5. The Keurig coffee maker was a great plus.6. The bathroom was a decent size. The rain shower was a nice feature.Cons:1. For $347 / night , it is not worth it.2. The room is too small. The walls are too thin. The beds are small. Even the lobby was very small.3. My daughter and I stayed at the first floor and it was so loud that we were jarred from our sleep several times.4. The room smelled musty and old when we got in.5. Our room does not even have the card slot to turn on the lights in the room. The hotel is outdated and old.6. There is no pool. There is no bar. There is no coffee shop in the hotel.Overall, my daughter and I had a very disappointing experience in Ocean View hotel. We did not get a decent sleep. No breakfast at the hotel.

There is a $35 charge for parking, but I knew this upfront so it wasn’t a surprise. I think this is why the hotel had good ratings on the trip advisor site.I had called before booking and was told that there would be fireworks on the Pier on July 4th, which was the reason for booking this hotel. We wanted to sit on the balcony and watch the fireworks from the hotel and not have to drive anywhere. When we got here, we were told that there are no fireworks allowed in Santa Monica and the closest fireworks display would be in Marina Del Ray. I was SUPER mad about this as we would have stayed at a nicer hotel in the area had we known the fireworks were not in play. So, things did not start off well from the get-go. Now, on to the room. The room is average. It had a musty smell which after only a few minutes, exacerbated my allergies and asthma. It has the general amenities such as a desk, TV, and closet space. There was a decent balcony in our room. Our sink wouldn’t drain, the toilet was not flushing properly and one of the lights didn’t have a lampshade. I was annoyed that I had to spend my first hour there calling maintenance and waiting for them to come fix this. The Wi-Fi was dreadful and we had NO BARS ON OUR PHONE in the room most of the time. It was difficult to make outgoing calls from the iPhone. They said the windows in our room were just made soundproof but I am here to tell you that they are not. The shower head is ill-placed and does not allow for easy mobility within the shower. Also, your hand must be under the running water in order to select the proper temperature (because the handle is on the opposite side of where you enter the shower), which makes no sense at all! The lighting in the bathroom is awful for makeup application.Unfortunately, a bar opened next door to the hotel a couple of weeks ago, and they blast music at 100 decibels until midnight. So, my next hour was spent calling the restaurant asking them to turn down the music and getting keys to different rooms to see if we could find a quieter location. That did not work out well and so we suffered with listening to loud music, which was also vibrating the room. All I wanted to do was try to hear the ocean waves but clearly that wasn’t going to happen. At this point, I immediately canceled our reservation for the remaining two nights. The rooms are absolutely paper thin and you can hear everything outside (street noise), everything in the breezeway/hall, and the guests stomping in the room above us. I had to call the front desk to ask them to call the people above us to please be quieter. So, after travelling for hours and hours, getting a good night’s sleep did not happen and I was even more aggravated. So, the day that was supposed to be enjoying Santa Monica turned into a complete waste of a day in LA.I did express my dismay to the front desk staff. They were apologetic; however, I do feel that it would have been appropriate to offer some type of compensation for the issues. The “I am sorry” was not much of a consolation when I felt like a whole day of the trip was ruined. So, if you don’t care about noise and are fine with basic/standard accommodations, then this place would be OK for you.","Dear beachboun09,First I'd like to thank you for taking the time to share such a detailed review.

Ocean View Hotel,30,"We stayed at Ocean View Hotel for one night as the last stop of the Route 66 trip. The hotel is located 1 block away from Santa Monica Pier! We were able to check in early, which was a great relief after surviving LA traffic. My 2 complaints are: 1. The cost of parking--$38.50 & 2. Poor wi-fi & limited cell signal. I expect for the money that you pay that wi-if should work & parking could be included or more competitive.

Ocean View Hotel,30,"Very good location - quick walk to beach and one or two blocks to the Promenade. Staff was courteous. Room clean. Nothing fancy. The highlight was the water views but they block the windows with shutters.

Ocean View Hotel,20,"The hotel itself is lovely, staff were so friendly and the location is perfect.However, I have never experienced a more noisy hotel than this.

Ocean View Hotel,30,"Location is fabulous. The place was clean and the staff was attentive. Then why only a 3? While it does have the obligatory bath robes and we did have a top floor king room with full ocean view, the room itself was rather small (as was the balcony). The road noise was excessive...so much so,that it didn't matter whether we left the balcony door open or closed...the closed windows did not soften the outside noise. The windows had nice indoor wooden shutters on them, but, by design, they couldn't be closed all the way and without shades or curtains, the room never approached being dark for sleeping. The mattress was quite comfortable, however, they put a mattress cover on it that made it feel that your sheet was right on top of a layer of plastic (though the cover was woven), which made me feel clammy throughout the night while the motel style wall AC unit cycled between nice and cool and too warm. Lack of available electrical sockets was also a problem, particularly on the right side of the bed, where the nearest one was 3 feet away under the middle of the desk. This would all be excusable at a moderately priced hotel at this location, but for my money, it was unimpressive. It's a value issue, not a ""bad"" hotel. There are other options in the area in this price range.","Dear mblam7,I'm sorry to hear you weren't fully satisfied with the value of our hotel but would like to thank you for bringing the points mentioned to our attention.

We could hear everyone coming and going in the corridor or in the car park. Also, could hear noise from the other guest rooms and the window rattled in the wind. Was not entirely clean when we entered the room (just dirty glasses), and we were charged for a water from the mini bar (which was rectified on notifying the hotel) so housekeeping not the best.","Dear Kirra F,I apologize if we failed to meet your expectations this past stay.

Ocean View Hotel,10,"While the hotel itself is lovely, the rooms are very comfortable and well appointed, DO NOT STAY HERE if you use and Android phone. Why? Because you will not be able to connect to the WIFI. Furthermore you will have to spend significant time on the phone with their Tech support. (In fact in order to connect my Apple IPAD I also had to get on the phone with Tech support at the hotel) Its great they have tech support, but coming to stay at a hotel and being forced to sit on the phone with Technical support (30 min x2 days) in the hope of having WIFI - whether for Android or Apple products. This may not be a major inconvenience for the majority of travelers, but living overseas and not having US cell phone service this is a major problem for me and is why I would not consider staying here again. Strangely this is not a problem I have encountered in any other hotel I have ever stayed in worldwide (elsewhere in the US, Europe, South America), so I must conclude it is a peculiarity of the WIFI at this hotel.","Dear Meghan L,My sincerest apologies on your connectivity issues with the Wifi.

Ocean View Hotel,20,"We arrived at around 7pm with a friendly welcome by the Valet. The receptionist then sorted our room out and we went up to our room we had booked in advance.(Room 1) Upon inspection the bathroom was not clean, hairs in the and shower, the floor was dirty and the shower door handle was loose. We went back down to reception to complain about the issue and they offered us a different room, which we took up.(Room 2) We had a dinner reservation for 8pm, so we were in a rush to swap rooms, we put our luggage and had a quick look around. Unbelievably, this room was also not clean! When we went down to catch our Uber for dinner, we spoke to the manager and asked him to have the room cleaned before our return from dinner, he apologised and gave us free parking for the two nights we were staying. When we got back we checked the room, as we were now sceptical about their cleaning abilities we checked the room further and it only got worse. The shower still had hairs in it, and we found a hair in the bed sheets along with stains on the pillow case. Another call to reception, who told us the manager had now gone for the evening. (9.40pm) They offered us a third room which we took, however it took until 10pm to get us to this room.(Room 3) This room had beach views (so was an upgrade on our first two car park view rooms). I'm pleased we hadn't paid a premium for it as the view was limited and you actually had all the road noise being on the front of the property. This room had been double checked before we got into it, and alas we had a clean room! Great. The young chap who helped us changed rooms was very polite and helpful.The next morning, we discovered that the window lock did not work in this room which we reported to reception and they had fixed while we were out that day.All three of the rooms we experienced were on the small side, we have stayed at 6 different hotels during our holiday (road trip) and these have been the smallest rooms by a large margin.The bathrooms, have poor water pressure and the ventilation is inadequate to deal with the steam of showering. The provided toiletries, were of a good standard. Also in all three bathrooms the toilet roll holder was loosely fitted to the wall, I suspect they need to upgrade these to a better standard of fitting.The furniture in the bedrooms is of good quality and the bed was comfy. Nice lighting and a good quality tv. There is a well stocked mini bar, which of course is hideously expensive. Half the hotels we have stayed at have provided free bottled water, which I think could easily be provided given the large price tag on these rooms.The location of this hotel is good, close to the pier, shopping and restaurants.The price of this hotel is not acceptable considering the experience we had. (We were also given $100 credit, after we had checked out by the manager, which we had not asked for, but it was a nice gesture given the experience).So we would not recommend staying here and we certainly will not be back anytime soon.","Dear Tim B,Allow me to apologize if we failed to meet your expectations this time around.

The noise carried on all night and was that loud you might have been trying to sleep on the balcony. This hotel really needs to invest in some decent double glazing.

Ocean View Hotel,30,"We splurged for the ocean front balcony and it was absolutely worth it. The location of this hotel is terrific - just one block from the Santa Monica pier, and lots of restaurants within walking distance. Parking is $30 per night but the valet service is very quick and friendly. The complimentary wifi is very slow and frustrating to connect, but once you are connected it doesn't terminate the connection until you do... then it is a slow and frustrating re-connecting experience. There is no pool in this hotel, no bar, and no kitchen or room service.","Dear Claire W,Thank you for sharing your thoughts on our hotel! It's wonderful to hear you enjoyed splurging on one of our ocean view rooms. I completely agree with you on our hotel having a terrific location in Santa Monica.

Ocean View Hotel,10,"We left this hotel (room 201) tired and dirty after a 4 night stay. The ocean view rooms sit over a restaurant / night club with thumping music and screaming people until 2am every night. Our shower faucet (w/ low flow rain head) was installed incorrectly, so we had either scalding hot water or freezing cold water to choose between. Our phone didn't work in our room, so if we needed to contact the front desk or call valet service, we had to take the elevator down to make those requests. After our first night, we asked for the shower and phone to be fixed, but they remained the same thru-out our stay. For an expensive hotel, the room amenities were in pretty bad shape. When I asked to speak with the manager, I was told he was off site. He was supposed to call me - he didn't; and has still not answered any of my post-visit phone calls.","Dear RosieG904,On behalf of the entire team I would like to apologize if you didn't enjoy your stay with us this time around.

Ocean View Hotel,20,"If you're looking for a hotel in the heart of everything then this is it. It's clean and in a great location. However, don't expect much more out of it. The receptionists are not very helpful and at times can be quite rude. Do not expect to sleep late and relax as it can be very noisy, even when all windows and doors are closed. We had a room without a view and it was still way too noisy! We were woken up every morning at 5:25am. If it wasn't the valet workers it was the workers next door. It seemed like the delivery trucks went through the valet station when making deliveries and the trucks would make these loud sounds and it seemed as if they were just baging things left and right! The price of the room was way too high considering it was impossible to relax in.Also, given the fact that we had no other option but to valet the car, we would quickly run out of change for tips. When we asked the front desk for change they made it seem as if we were asking for an impossible task and ultimately told us to ask the valet for change. When we did, they conveniently didn't have any change forcing us to give them a big tip. That was very tacky in my opinion.","Dear angiepNewYork,I apologize if you didn't have a pleasant experience this time around.

Ocean View Hotel,30,"Most of the hotels in this price range or higher are a good location to everything. However, Ocean View, Georgian and Shores hotels are the closest to 3rd St shopping and the better restaurants while still overlooking the water. The other 2 hotels mentioned have bars that you can grab a drink and take to your room, Ocean View does not have a bar nor does it have a restaurant. Ocean View you do pay for price and any other location I would not pay for an average hotel. Room was clean, bathroom updated, beds comfy.

Ocean View Hotel,30,"This hotel is located right across the street from the Santa Monica Pier and is close to the 3rd Street Promenade so has a fabulous location with world class shopping, dining and tourism. The hotel is nicely decorated and has a boutique feel to the lobby area. The parking attendant was incredibly helpful and nice! Our room was not ready upon arrival so we were told to leave our bags, enjoy the area and come back a little later. When we returned the room was still not ready. We waited and waited and finally were able to get into the room itself which was a disappointment. Although nicely appointed and updated, the room had a door that opens off of an outdoor hallway like old-fashioned motels. The window in the room had no view and the two double beds made the room feel incredibly cramped and small. The bathroom was very modern and felt new. There was a nearby bar and the noise level was so loud through most of the night it was challenging to get any sleep and I can usually sleep through anything! Overall, I felt the room was very overpriced for what we got and would not stay there again.","Dear itsallheart,I would like to apologize if the room wasn't ready when you arrived to the hotel.

Ocean View Hotel,30,"We were so looking forward to staying here for a couple of days. The website made the hotel seem amazing. For 2 nights with parking our bill was over 800.00. We were expecting a fabulous stay for this price. Let me just say it has a great location and view and that's about it. The hotel walks were thin so you heard everything above, below, and in the hallways. We had to ask 4 different times for a rollaway bed and the same for pillows. The maid didn't replenish toiletries so I had to call down for those. Our room key stopped working after day 1 so that was obviously miscoded. Maintenance also used the same elevators with their carts as the guests.There was just too much not happening in their favor for these prices. We had come here from the Hilton in Anaheim which was impeccable and quite a bit cheaper. If you like to wake early this is the place for you. Noisy, full of light, just not restful.

Ocean View Hotel,20,"Decided to stay a couple of nights in santa monica after a few nights in Vegas. The hotel has a nice location close to the beach and the restaurants, and looked nice on the websites. However, getting any good sleep was impossible. Having a room with a courtyard view we expected some noicereduction avoiding the street/beach and nightlife. We were very wrong. Continous noise from car alarms going off at the valleparking, trash being taken out, glass breaking (trash), and some kind of buzzing sound that similars to a horrrible doorbell of some sort (went on for ages and no idea what it was)- all trought the night at different times gave us barely any sleep. The ironic part is that the sounds from the nightlife didn't bother us at all.Also, charing 30 dollars each day for parking is horrendous keeping in mind the high night rate.We paid less in total at Wynn in Vegas for a pretty luxurious room with a good view. And the valleparking was included.Overall clean, helpful staff, free wifi, good location - but not worth the rate as presented, expecially not without getting any sleep. Too noisy.

Whether it was just boisterous guests or an actual parties going on during our stay I’m not sure, but it all sounded like it was in the room next door.

Checking in was fine and the two gentlemen on the front desk were friendly, you do have to leave a small refundable deposit ($100 at the time of writing) for your stay, however I did feel uncomfortable with the hotel taking my passport and making a photocopy of it - I don’t know of any hotel outside of Eastern Europe who does this practice and see no reason for doing this with guests, that aside, check-in was completed and was I was shown where the lift was. My room (classed as Starlet Queen); was an odd combination of modern and updated, with a slightly run down bathroom. Good Wi-Fi, excellent choice of TV channels (yes I like TV!), microwave and fridge (didn’t use) and coffee maker. I have to say the coffee was lovely for being a known brand name (Starbucks) as usually it’s a bland blend supplied. The bathroom had a small makeover in relation to the mirror and taps, but the walls were not repainted nor tiled to an updated standard. The cleaning of the bathroom also left a lot to be desired. I don’t really mind if the odd hair is visible as this can’t be helped, however the floor really did look like someone had had body alopecia, never once was it mopped during my stay and it showed. However my room generally was cleaned to a good standard throughout with towels refreshed and coffee topped up etc. Plug sockets however left a lot to be desired - one was hanging off the wall and certainly couldn’t be used safely, another was behind a heavy unit (where the safe and microwave are) with it also slightly hanging off the wall, the only socket safe enough was below the TV so charging items was a bit of a challenge at times. The bed was very comfortable but the pillows less so as very flimsy and flat. The worse part of my stay though is the noise from the constant door slamming - literally you’ve never heard anything like it and needs addressing - slam, Slam, SLAM! People staying really had no consideration for others and this continued late into the night and early in the morning. The closers on the door are ineffectual, a sign asking people to close doors quietly would be a great help as the first two nights I barely slept. On day three, and returning after a day out, I went to reception and asked if I could transfer rooms, I was met with the most hostile receptionist (if you know the musical Oliver, then you’ll know the name of Bill Sikes’s girlfriend - should you never have the misfortune to be served by her) - She couldn’t have cleared less, patronising in tone and manner, bluntly and loudly informing me in front of her male colleagues that I should have come to her in the morning (?!) and that nothing can be done, when I stated that they had other rooms on the website she just repeated herself louder and though it was funny. The final insult being that she offered me ear plugs - WOW! I just walked away as people like that are not worth dealing with. Breakfast was included (didn’t eat their) plus a bar area open for cocktails and drinks in the evening. Checking out was fine and the two ladies very kindly stored my luggage for the day and were so pleasant and helpful. The area itself feels a little unsafe at night but it’s just that, a feeling and it’s fine. Some local food eateries are close by but there really isn’t much in the immediate area. The subway however is just a five minute walk (station Vermont/Santa Monica on the Red Line, usually every 12 mins or so); some people have pointed out the homeless and vagrants hanging outside the station but again, it’s like any big city and they do not bother you. So, with all of that said would I stay again? Here’s the thing, if you could fix the slamming of doors then actually I would stay again! My room was fine on the whole, and as I don’t drive pubic transport was close by and quick to travel, and by the time I left, I had actually enjoyed my stay - so make of it what you will!","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"We arrived at ‘The Hollywood Hotel’ just after midnight. I waited at the front desk for a time and when the hotel receptionist finally came around the corner he was dismissive and impatient. Our reservation was made through Expedia.com, so he was unaware of our request for a larger room and roll away cot. This seemed to annoy him. We headed upstairs to find that the card keys to our room did not work. We waited in the hall instead of going back to the front desk, because he said he would bring the roll-away bed. When asking for new card keys he gave me a look of disdain and then proceeded to try all four of the card keys, which as previously stated did not open the door. He used his manager key to let us in our room and told us we had to push the bed into the room and set it up ourselves. He turned in his heel and left presumably to make us new keys. After waiting 20 minutes, I went downstairs to pick up the keys. Already travel weary, I did not appreciate the attitude and inhospitable treatment. Especially upon finding out the next day that due to the coronavirus, the hotel was only at 18% capacity.The room itself was relatively clean, just worn as the photos show. Our showers were lukewarm and so was the room. Sadly, the airflow could not be adjusted. There was an AC panel on the wall, but no power to the unit.The outdoor spaces and pool looked beautiful in the photos, however due to rain they were closed to hotel patrons for the four days we were booked. The explanation was that someone could slip and fall. Isn’t that implied? it’s a swimming pool, water 💦After two days of rain, we left LA and went to San Diego. The Hollywood Hotel had us prepay for the roll-away cot and parking for our four day stay. When we tried to check out after two days, they said our 4 day reservation was non-refundable and refused to give us our money back for the 2 days we would not be using the roll-away cot or parking.The only bright star in this whole escapade and waste of hard-earned money was the breakfast. The Chef was wonderful! His omelets and maple waffles were delicious. He was personable, and the entire breakfast staff was very sweet.",Dear guest...Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"When looking at the pictures on Expedia or the hotel’s own website, the hotel looks really nice and almost luxurious but do NOT expect this. First of all, the room was old and in bad shape (See the pictures). Then the cold water wasn’t working so the water was boiling hot and it started to leak under the sink. We told the receptionist this and he said someone would come within an hour and take care of it. When we came back to the hotel several hours later in the evening, nobody had been there. Then we talked to the receptionist the next day and finally it was fixed.Also, the old hairdryer wasn’t working and sometimes the light wasn’t working. All in all, everything was just old, worn, and could use a renovation.Next time I would also pick another location as there were a lot of homeless people and people who made the area uncomfortable.",Dear Guest...Please accept my sincerest apologies for the conditions described in your review.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"We arrived Sunday 1/26/20. Poor check in experience. Our flight & Lyft has us at the hotel by 1:50. We were told to sit and wait until at least 2:30. We checked a couple of times after and still had to wait as the “Jr. suite” room we had booked wasn’t ready yet.. After 3pm we checked and was told it would be another couple of hours, or they could put us into a newly renovated room “for no additional charge” Around 3:45 we finally got into room 209. The room A/C didn’t work. When we called the front desk to complain they told us it was part of their “green Initiative ” We had to sleep with the balcony door open to cool down the room to our comfort level. Then, at least twice during our stay we had to close it as somebody was smoking outside and the smell was coming into our room.... despite the fact that it was advertised as a non-smoking hotel.The room fridge was barely below roomtemps. We asked that it be adjusted since the knob to do so, was removed. We had to throw away food leftovers as they weren’t kept cold enough to be safe to eat.We were a little disappointed that we had to live out of our suitcases for the week as there were no drawers for our clothes only a small rolling rack with hangers. Our TV remote didn’t work and had to be replaced. Also our Safe wasn’t working and had to be fixed.Chef Bruno was rather unpleasant to my husband when he asked to put some sliced deli ham into his omelette , which had been done the morning before by the woman working.The bathroom shower took a solid 2 minutes of running to get hot water.Midweek they were sanding/grinding down the elevator doors on the lobby level. By the time we checked out on Sunday, the residue was still not cleaned up off the floor/left corner of the door.The only saving grace was The 2 friendly gals at the front desk.We had to search for the pool. It’s not in the building, you had to walk across the parking lot.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"First let me tell you that I am not very picky about hotels when they have reasonable rates, and this hotel does have very reasonable rates. However, our experience there was mediocre, at best. When we checked in, I had to sign documents promising that we would follow the rules. They took a $100 deposit even though it was a regular credit card. We had to pay almost $30 a night to park the car. Everything was very persnickety. The hotel is not in a nice area. The subway is a block away, but there are homeless people living in tents on the sidewalk going to the subway. The subway itself scared me. We are from NY and often ride the subway without issue, but it is very clear that no one is patrolling these stations. After that ride, we drove or took an Uber everywhere. When we asked at the front desk if the neighborhood was safe, we got a response as if he was insulted. We decided to venture out and that's when we ran into the tents, garbage strewn all over the sidewalk, and people being very aggressive outside the subway entrance.The room was big and had a lovely view of the courtyard, which was very pretty. It is old though. The floor is linoleum or something like that. The TV was not quite in front of the bed, but off to the side. Although housekeeping did make up the bed and empty the garbage, they did not clean out the ice bucket and put it back. The shower was fantastic. The water pressure was great.As far as the breakfast goes, the reviews on here make me laugh. It looked incredible, but looks can be deceiving. There is an omelette bar and a chef there. He was not friendly at all. The rest of the food was ridiculous. The bacon was sliced so thin, you could see through it. I don't know how they accomplished that. They had tater tots for hashbrowns. They had store bought bagels, the kind from a package and a basket of bread to make toast. They had coldcuts (???) and cereal. The orange juice tasted like water with an orange essence. Plus, the chef would make waffles upon request. I mean, it was free, and food is food, but the breakfast at the La Quinta or Comfort Inn.All in all, it was okay, but if I return to the area, I will choose a place in a safer, walkable neighborhood that is newer.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"Beautifully remodeled rooms, beautiful building, nice staff, good continental breakfast. Not a place to be walking out after dark, especially alone. I was alone on this trip and didn’t even feel comfortable driving near it. Drug users and homeless everywhere. I think you may be ok during the day but being single I did not try it.Also, if you’d like to sleep past 6:30 without doors slamming constantly, you should find a different hotel. The beautiful, heavy doors have nothing on them to keep from slamming loudly. They have a sign saying to respect the others but obviously that isn’t working. They need to actually put something on them.All in all, it was a great nights sleep until 6ish. 😁 the bed was very comfortable if you like a more firm mattress.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"It seems like a lot of these reviews are not real. Too many posting from people with 1 contribution on Trip Advisor. This is a real unbiased review. When pulling up to the hotel from the main road I was concerned with the appearance and dated exterior. The nice fountain pictured is in the back gated parking area. I was greeted at the front desk by Pil. He was lovely, friendly and put me at ease with my choice of hotel. The room was basic and dated but cleanliness was no issue. I got a room facing the courtyard and it was very quiet the entire 2 nights of my stay. On to the reason you want to stay here. The free breakfast is fantastic and Hugo's reputation is well earned. Friendly and happy to serve up delicious omelets or waffles. In addition to the fresh made items there are pastries and breads and cereals and yogurts. Plenty for all. I would stay here again as this is a hotel that fits within my budget for my travel needs in LA and the location is close to my daughter's apartment.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"This hotel does not live up to its promotional photos and advertising.The Pros: room and bathroom are clean. Cleaning staff are very friendly. Bed is very comfortable. Close to Metro red line. Breakfast was limited although you can get fresh omelettes made to order.Cons: Location although close to the Metro and the LA hospital district, is not particularly good with homeless people sleeping on the streets outside, derelict andrun down buildings nearby.Hotel interior everywhere except reception is old, dark and jaded. Rooms and passageways are dark due to poor lighting. No ceiling lights just low wattage wall lights.No carpets- floors are vinyl timber look. Floors and rooms are cold. Furnishings are all dark. Inside generally is a bit depressing. A/c is slow to kick in and has noisy ceiling air vents- if it is windy outside they rattle loudly. No plates or cutlery just disposable thin plastic cups. Shower is over bath- our shower head had very poor pressure although the other taps were fine. Very few power points. To charge more than one thing at the same time was a problem. Sliding door to the balcony had a very suspect and unsafe lock.Only one elevator down to the basement breakfast room and it was so unbelievably slow every morning I was expecting to find someone in it who had died of hunger.In conclusion this hotel is old, worn out and in urgent need of modernisation.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"This was a hard review.... the staff, especially Nicole and Beatriz were great!!! The room was pretty nice for the most part and clean. The breakfast was pretty good, especially the made to order waffles and omelets! This hotel is close to the metro which is a nice way to skip on all the traffic!! There is a RiteAid right next door, gas station a block away, and a bunch of quick food options close by. There is also a little shop on the first floor with GREAT prices on everything!Now for the little less than satisfying...The rooms had NO AC and were kinda stuffy. You could open the windows for a little airflow but there were no screens on them so that can only be for so long. The Courtyard was pretty but basically closed down with no cushions on any of the furniture. The pool was really quiet so we never actually went down to it. The property is a little hard to distinguish from the street as we were looking for what appeared to be the front from the pictures and that was actually the back of the hotel that was only accessible through a large metal gate after pressing the intercom to speak to the front desk. There are several tents around on the sidewalks and while noone approaches us at all, with a 7 year old in tow, it was a little off putting. We still felt ok walking around at night just definitely aware of our surroundings. The Metro is a couple short blocks away and while very convenient, it is also very enlightening! Other than a ride service, this is really the only option of getting to and from places unless you have your own car.Overall not awful, but definitely not the best either.",ear GuestThank you for reviewing your recent stay with us at Hollywood Hotel on TripAdvisor.I’m very sorry to hear that we were unable to fully meet your expectations and deliver the service we are known for during your time with us in Hollywood.Your feedback has been shared with management .

Asked for a plate to microwave left over pizza and they said they didn’t have any... they left a dirty old ice bag in the room so I called and asked for a new one and they said they didn’t have any.... also room service was non existent. Didn’t get our beds made. House keeping came and took our dirty towels but didn’t leave new ones or make the bed or take the garbage out lol so I took the garbage out and left it in the hallway... ugh wouldn’t stay here again.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"Stayed at the hotel with my wife for 16 days and it was kind of a disaster. It all started in the first week, the hotel was going through a remodeling work and guess what? They did not tell us that before we booked and pre paid for the room. At first I gave the front desk a call, and they lied saying it would only be for a couple of days. After a week the loud noises kept on bothering us, how about waking up on a Sunday at 08am with a few construction workers hammering stuff 01 feet from your door room ? I had an argument at the front desk and demanded they gave me a new room, but they said I would have to check out and wait on lobby for 4 hours before getting a new room. After insisting they told me I did not have to wait and they moved me to a new room. In the both rooms I stayed the showers did not have hot water 💧 only after 08pm. I would not recomendo anyone staying at this hotel, especially, if like is you’re a foreign. The staff does not clean well and they also don’t speak English. The only good thing about the hotel was Hugo, the omelete guy. The area is also full of homeless people and the parking costs 27 bucks a day, yeah that’s right. I’m truly thinking about suing the hotel once I get back to Brazil. I paid a lot of money for my stay and to be able to sleep well. But I Didn’t. that’s it.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"DO NOT STAY HERE. Absolutely awful!!! All the bad reviews already posted are spot on. Manager was extremely rude, inconsiderate and unaccommodating to all our concerns. Baby crib was dirty and held together with packing tape. Scary black mold in the bathroom. Squeaky doors. Room was super cold and only had a tiny space heater that took hours to get the room to an acceptable body temperature. Room has no closet and no draws, we had to keep our clothes and items in the suitcases. Disgustingly dirty poolside chair cushions and pool area swarmed with mosquitoes making it literally impossible to lounge poolside. Not eco friendly, all cups in the room were paper and plastic.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"I will start by saying that Brian at the front desk was SUPER accommodating and helpful. He helped find me a room when I had accidentally booked the wrong dates. He recommended a great dinner spot and was just generally awesome. The hotel on the other hand, was a different story. My room was quaint and cute and fulfilled my need but the rest of the hotel was dark and dirty and weird. My shower kept just randomly running at anytime. There was nothing to wipe any of the equipment down in the gym - no paper towels or spray. I let the very nice girl at the desk know and I told her the hand sanitizer was empty. She looked like she scribbled something down on a piece of paper but the next day it was still empty and no paper towels or spray. I’m not a germaphobe but that’s nasty.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"I chose the Hollywood Hotel after reading all the good reviews on here. But after arriving and seeing the hotel and my room I was shocked. The pictures look great online but in person it’s a little run down (you also can’t tell that the balconies are shared) My wife usually lets me do all the planning for vacations and I’m normally on top of it. But we both agreed after this trip that my streak was over. Overall the room was dirty with stains on the bed and even the lamp shade. There was mold and rust in the bathrooms. It was a toss up on if we had hot water in the morning. It was annoying at first, but it actually became comical towards the end of the trip. My sole purpose for writing this review is to give a little warning to the other husbands out there that think they’re getting a steal on the cost. Pay a little extra and stay in a nicer hotel in a safer part of Hollywood. This hotel would be better suited towards college kids trying find a cheap hotel in Hollywood but not so much a family or a couple. Lesson learned on my part.On a positive note, Beatriz was very sweet and helped us check in early.","Dear Guest...Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"Stayed here for four nights on holiday with my husband.First the good points:Room was pretty spacious and well equipped. Nice toiletries, plenty of towels, fridge, microwave (although this needed a clean), Starbucks coffee for machine.Complimentary breakfast with freshly made eggs; omelettes, scrambled, fried etc and also waffles made to order. Wide range of bread for toast. Bagels and muffins. Fruits. Potatoes and sausages. Cheese, ham, preserves etc and coffee.Staff were pretty friendly and helpful.Good location near metro and the area overall was pretty decent.Now the bad:Husband accumulated over 60 insect bites by the pool one afternoon. No advice on check in or warnings or the mosquito epidemic which they were aware of. Also no pre preventative measures taken by hotel around the pool. Response when raised was pretty much we don’t care. Nothing we can do. Having travelled extensively to mosquito ridden countries we’ve never experienced attacks like this.At least warn people that there’s an issue.Beds were very hard and pillows like paper.Attempting to retrieve bags from the store when leaving was a hassle.A few small improvements could make this really good.","Dear Guest..We do apologize for the fact that your stay did not match your expectations! We are so sorry for the mosquitos. We find mosquitoes in Los Angeles all spring and summer long, due to the rise of temperature.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"I looked at reviews on this hotel & they were all pretty good with the pros & cons so I decided to go for it! This is NOT a place to take your family!! There aren’t any restaurants in walking distance & if there were you sure don’t want to walk there with your family.....it’s a very shady neighborhood. You have to Uber or Lyft to get to any kind of restaurant or bar.....or anywhere. I was able to look past that until the rest of the amenities fell through. Every single vending machine on every floor was either empty or didn’t work......we couldn’t even get a water or snack for the kids. They also advertised they had a bar/lounge. Upon arrival they informed us it wasn’t open till Wednesday, when Wednesday rolled around they were still not open. The people walking around once the sun went down we’re something you don’t want your children to see. My husband & I saw drug related activity off our balcony that as an adult I did not want to see. It’s a beautiful hotel.......if your going to advertise being a family hotel you need to make sure it’s for families!

Hollywood Hotel,10,"We booked this hotel thinking it was the best value in LA because it had a pool, included breakfast & cheapish parking. It also looked in relatively good decorative order from photos.In reality it wasn’t very nice! Our room, and therefore all our belongings became infested with ants from their drains (pics attached). Most of the facilities are okay but the rooms are in horrible decorative order and didn’t feel very clean. This therefore made me not want to use the pool. If you get an outside room rather than a courtyard it’s also incredibly noisy!The hotel kept turning our electricity off so our phones wouldn’t charge over night. I rang 4 times to ask them to stop turning it off until they admitted they were via their computer systems, very strange!","Dear Guest..We do apologize for the fact that your stay did not match your expectations!

Hollywood Hotel,20,"My husband and I came to Hollywood celebrating our wedding anniversary. We stayed Sept. 14th-19th. This hotel looked really nice on the website and got mostly good reviews, included a buffet breakfast, a pool, a restaurant along with a courtyard bar and A/C. I thought it was a great deal. We arrive and were told that the restaurant was closed due to a power outage. Also only ONE working elevator for three floors! That was very inconvenient because the elevator that was working was very slow so we took the stairs a lot. The courtyard bar was having happy hour between 2 to 7pm daily. First day we go out there, there was no one around and we noticed there were appetizers sitting out that was covered in flies! We decided to check out the pool. Pool area looked nice...BUT you couldn't sit in the lounge chairs without getting eaten alive by huge aggressive mosquitos that left huge bites on you. We stayed in a standard queen room with a balcony overlooking the street. Our room was clean, but noticed there was chipped paint throughout room, black scuff marks on the walls, rust on the ceiling of the shower area, etc. Our balcony didn't have chairs out there to sit in, the bed was the worst - felt like we were sleeping on a slab of concrete and woke up sore each day. You either need a car, take the bus or get an Uber/Lyft to get to major attractions. There is a Rite Aid about a block away that you can get basic needs from which was convenient. The breakfast buffet was great and had a large variety to choose from. The staff was nice and the maids did a great job cleaning our room each day. This hotel also charges $27 a night to park your car. Overall, I wouldn't stay at this hotel again. It was a major disappointment.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"Staying for 6 nights with my son. We took a fly away coach from Lax to union street station which was $10. We got on the red line underground line to Vermont/sunset station $2.75 each then walked down the hill to the hotel. We’ve never been before, we are pretty resourceful and we found this trip from Lax pretty easy.Room was ok nothing special but clean. Was overlooking the car park. Beds comfy and room service made up our room. The air conditioning in the room works well but is the loudest air conditioning unit I’ve ever heard. Microwave, fridge and safe in the room. Some sort of coffee maker but the coffee is horrible.Pool is clean, sun beds clean and towels provided. Pretty quiet round the pool. Used the gym which is pretty small with minimal equipment but has What you would need.Breakfast is fine and will get you by. I know it says free complimentary breakfast but nothing is for free and I would suggest that they account for this in the room price.Metro bus stop outside. We walked to Hollywood walk if fame (disappointing) which seemed to take forever but is walkable if you really feel the need to go. Took bus 704 west off sunset which took us to Santa Monica pier in about an hour and you can get off in the way. Fair full day cost $5.00.There is nothing to do in the local area, I certainly would not be walking round here on an evening. I ran across the road to the local liquor store for chocolate and I did not feel safe. There is very little food options without a car.I wouldn’t stay here again but it would be more to do with the location rather than the hotel itself.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"When we got to the hotel, it was not as nice as it looks on the website. Our room was not in great shape. Aside from being small, a bit shabby, lacking the advertised amenities, it also had lots of little bugs in the shower. My husband thought they might be fleas but we don’t know. When we checked in, it was already quite late, but my husband did not want to bring any bugs home with us. So we he went down to the desk to ask about a new room, but they did not have a another available room with 2 queens. After some talking, they did graciously give us 2 rooms with 1 bed each so we split up with our kids. The two new rooms did not have bugs — hooray! But they were a bit shabby. The room my husband and daughter had clearly had had updates, but it still did not have a great paint job, tiling, etc. The other room was again very shabby.By morning, a manager came up and graciously offered to let us out of our second prepaid night.We skipped breakfast here because we were just too grossed out by the hotel. Then we checked into the Hyatt Place in Glendale — a huge improvement!

Hollywood Hotel,30,"2歳の子どもと一緒に8日間宿泊しました。朝ご飯つきはありがたかったですが、オムレツを焼いてくれるシェフの方がかなり愛想悪いです。ビュッフェの内容は、パンとベーコン、ハッシュドポテトとチーズという非常にベーシックです。部屋はWIFI環境が悪く、中々アクセスできませんでした。また、フロントデスクの対応も悪く、なんだかなーといった感じです。ホテルにコインランドリーはありますが、しっかりとメンテンナンスされておらず、コインを入れて洗剤を買おうとしても販売機から出てきませんでした。フロントに聞くと「在庫切れです」とこれまた不愛想に言われ、結局ホテルの向かいのコインランドリーまで行く羽目に。オフィシャルサイトから予約したため、特典付きだったのですが、この特典についてもフロントデスクは全く把握しておらず会話にならなくて残念でした。We stayed with toddler for 8 nights. It was good to have free bfast buffet, but the chef who cooks omelette was so unfriendly and looked so mad or something. not for 1day but everyday. The menu of buffet was quite basic- bread, bacon, cheese and some potato. Wifi was quite slow and lost network quite often. The staff at front desk was unfriendly and unhelpful. There was 3girls and one of them was looks like trainee. other 2 girls were just taking care of that girl and the guests in the queue were ignored. They have coin laundry but not managing well.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"Check in was easy with very friendly and welcoming staff. They also helped with the parking - there is a secure car park at rear costs $27 a day. Our room felt small compared to other hotels we had stayed in and the decor was 'tired'. There was very little space for our suitcases and hanging space for clothes was a rail over a sideboard and the ironing board and iron were stored in the space.. The bathroom was also small. We overlooked a small courtyard which is very pleasant - they advertised a welcome drink between 5-7 but this never materialised the two nights we stayed. The breakfast was okay - reasonable choice and the chef on duty works really really hard cooking fresh omelottes and waffles. There are several places to eat within easy walking distance - there's a Wendy's, and then Le Figaro, a fabulous French bistro and an Italian. Lovely food. It's also not far to bus stops and the metro. The pool area was okay - the sunbeds are heavy and difficult to move around. Towels are provided. The staff were great apart from an older woman whoi we overheard speaking to others and we thought her very rude. Overall an old hotel established in the early 1900's showing its age but scores well because of the staff.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"We made reservations with this hotel because my husband was having 2 procedures done at Kaiser Sunset which was a couple of blocks away. We booked with a non-refundable rate. After we made the reservation we got a email from the hotel showing all of the ""extra charges"" like parking in their parking lot $27 + tax a night. We had a 7lb dog with us & were told there was a $50 + tax a night cleaningfee for her. We got there after 3pm & checked in, went to WaBa & got take out. Came back, ate our food & went to bed. Our little dog slept in her canvas crate & was not out in the room. The next morning my husband had his first appointment at 7am so we left at about 6:30am & I told the front desk we didn't need housekeeping. Our dog was left in her crate the whole time we were gone. My husband wasn't released from the hospital until 7:30pm. We checked out before 8am the next morning. Our dog is a little Diva & she will not walk on tile or wood floors so she was either in her crate or on her little blanket. When I was checking out I asked if we could get a refund on one night dog cleaning because the room hadn't been cleaned. Plus you would not have been able to tell that a dog had been in the room. I was told no, that is their policy. We didn't get to take advantage of anything else but the room & ice machine. The hotel is older & in the downtown area. We ended up paying $535 after they added on all their extras. When you look at the web site it doesn't say there are extra charges for a lot of things.

Very seedy.Far away from tourist areas.Reception are very abrupt. Not at all helpful.The building is old. Maintenance is ok.What you expect for their ratings.In the rooms you have soft plastic cups. And only one each, per stay.No glasses available. I was told to go buy them at the nearby store!!Car parking is us$28.00 per night. (Compared to us$25 per day for our hire car)The last day, we returned to our room & found the housemaid had locked herself into our room. And when we entered, our bags had been searched!! Thankfully only a small amount of money was missing.The only positive; The beds are ok.Quite soft. And breakfast is fairly good.But please do yourself a favor.

This was a quick trip to LA for a few days where we knew we would be out most of the time. We booked this as it seemed to be a cost effective place. Even though the price was reasonable, it was not worth it.We knew this was a budget priced hotel and did not attempt to compare it to the high end, luxury hotels we usually frequent. However, terrible is terrible.We had booked a queen suite. The bed was not a queen, but a full size. For two adults, it was extremely tight. We complained to the manager who argued that the bed was a queen. It absolutely was not.The suite had one chair and the bed. There was no other place to sit.The outside of the building is attractive.

Our room was spacious but not the cleanest - we found a pair of socks from a previous owner under the table and the bathroom was looking pretty shabby. Breakfast was included so don’t be conned by buying rooms with breakfast as extra. Unfortunately the breakfast wasn’t up to scratch and the staff were the rudest people around. In particular the chef who had something against anyone who asked for anything despite it being his job! The worst thing of the whole stay was coming back to find, what looked like an ecstasy tablet on my 6-yr olds bed. Luckily he didn’t put it in his mouth but this made us feel extremely uncomfortable and the attitude of the staff was, to say the least, bordering on disinterested despite our concerns. We asked for an investigation which they have refused and failed to answer emails and messages repeatedly.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"I picked this hotel specifically for its location near a niece and nephew we were visiting. It is a nicely kept very retro hotel with historic appeal. The staff are very nice and accommodating. There is secured gated parking and There is a very safe feeling at the hotel. The rooms are very small and poorly lighted. The beds are extremely firm and pillows are small. Breakfast included in a basement ""restaurant"" (think embassy suites - type breakfast but a bit more limited selection). I ended up not using the TV as it spent most of the time in a ""no signal"" mode. It is convenient to Hollywood and the studios etc. Close to Children's Hospital. Overall, a decent place with historic value, in need of some painting in halls and maybe an upgrade of furniture. Glad I experienced it but probably would not stay here again.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"This hotel put a dampener on our LA trip. I would NOT recommend it.There were some positives:* The rooms were clean.* The room had a microwave and fridge.* The shower was hot and powerful.* There was ample parking* It looked like lots of the hotel had been refurbished recently.* The omelette chef made a great omelette and was very cheerful/friendly in the morning. There were also 10 different cereals to choose from so it looked like there would a great breakfast.However, the customer service was poor. We had one significant issue and a several minor problems, all were dealt with a take it or leave it attitude.One day after being at a theme park all day we came back to find our room door open. The maid had not pulled the door shut so for the best part of the day anyone could have helped themselves to our belongings (passports, jewelry, etc).The management apologized but didn’t see the severity of the issue and tried to spin it into a positive.Other issues we had were:* It took over 30 mins to check in - not enough staff at the desk.* Room was very cold and the marble floor added to this issue. There was a small portable radiator but it took hours for it to have an effect on the room. The hotel couldn’t provide any slippers or any other solution.* Sound traveled easily - one night we were awoken by noisy guests returning to their rooms and on the final day we were awoken at 7.30 by construction noise* Each day there were flies on the open bread and fruit in at breakfast buffet* For 2 of our 4 day stay, the shampoo and conditioner were not replenished. Reception said they’d send more but this took nearly an hour. (This may sound trivial, but we all wanted to shower before bed and this meant we had less sleep; by the end of the trip we were very tired).* Pillows were very soft* Lifts were slow and old.Also the surrounding neighborhood did not feel very safe. So we would only drive to nearby coffee shops etc.Overall the hotel shows some promise but the management have a “can’t be bothered attitude”, so I would suggest you stay clear.",Dear Guest...Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"The list of pros about this hotel is short: great location and fantastic breakfast.As for the cons; The entire property is severely worn down, with dirty carpets, cracks in the ceilings and peeling wallpaper. When we first came into the room, we noticed how worn down it was, but half the outlets also did not work, so we had to go down to the reception who then fixed it. Not long after, we noticed that there were ants crawling EVERYWHERE. In the beds even! When we complained we were told that an employee would come up and spray the room, but since we felt it was simply just too disgusting to stay in, we were moved to a new room, that only had a couple of visible ants.The entire time we were dealing with getting a new room, the employee of the hotel was extremely condescending and asking if we ""didn't have ants where we came from"". Insulting and borderline racist. Generally ants do not show up repeatedly unless you have a problem that you are not addressing. In this hotel's case, my money is on their very low standard of cleanliness and the poor upkeep of the rooms.The new room was bigger, but was just as worn down. The employee sprayed the room down and promised us there would be no ants, but within 4 days they were crawling on the walls there as well. I shudder to think how many ants crawled around in our luggage and came home with us.Additionally, the housekeeping will not respect if you don't want them to come into the room - they will enter anyway - even if the sign is up and they do not keep their hands to themselves. We had several items thrown out which was not in the trash or meant to be thrown out.In the aftermath, we tried to get some form of compensation from Hollywood Hotel and the third party site we booked through, but both parties have been utterly unhelpful and unresponsive.We had hoped that this would be our go-to hotel in Los Angeles, but this was most certainly our last stay. This hotel is vastly overpriced considering the condition of the rooms, but I would rather spend more and then be guaranteed some standard of cleanliness and a pest free stay.","Dear Guest...Sorry to hear the issue you have experienced.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"I was a bit concerned about this hotel as I'd read some poor reviews, particularly as we'd booked a cheap room through a third party booking site. My concerns were well placed - you get what you pay for.Positives - the hotel is in a bit of a middle-of-nowhere area but is well-located for many of the main tourist attractions in north-central LA. It'll only take you 15 minutes in a car or taxi to Griffith Park or Downtown, 20 minutes to dead central Hollywood. The communal areas of the hotel are also good: the pool area is clean and attractive, as are the outside frontage, reception, courtyard, bar, breakfast area and corridors. Their prices are good for the area the hotel is in. Service was good during our stay - even if it was obvious that housekeeping only turned the bedsheets, rather than replacing them (I discovered this when a piece of tape accidentally left on the bed magically turned up inside it the next day!)The rooms are in the process of renovation. If you book their cheapest rooms, prepare to get their cheapest rooms. Some of the rooms seem to not have been updated for five or ten years, and are very worn and rough. Our Two Queens room on the second floor was clean and mercifully ant-free (see previous poor reviews.) However, a three-star hotel room it was not. The room was dark and gloomy. The fridge did not work. The air conditioning was weak, paintwork was chipped and wallpaper was peeling throughout. The drain in the shower was loose, the shower head was falling out of the wall, and the floor was slippery. The electrical plug sockets were an obvious health hazard: you couldn't even plug things into some of them without the plug falling out, and with others, the contacts hung at a precarious angle. I'm very glad I didn't travel with curious children, as it would have been very easy to get a shock from these.I have stayed in plenty of three star hotels that have been basic, but fresh and functional. This hotel room was basic, but neither fresh nor functional, and desperately in need of an update.I suppose it's our fault for booking the cheapest possible rate, as we are a pair of young travellers on a budget. However, we did include a message with our booking saying it was for a special occasion, hoping that we might at least get a recently renovated room - particularly as we were returning customers. We did not.Having looked at other reviews, I would advise that if you stay at this hotel, you should book at one of their higher rates, through their website directly, and do not go for the cheapest you can find. If you book the cheapest, you will get the worst they have.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"CONS:The rooms are not clean or maintained - some rooms are newly renovated, but I have stayed here twice and always end up in the worn down ones. So keep this in mind when reading reviews. The rooms are very poorly lit, the ceiling has cracks, the wallpaper is falling off and the floor is dirty. The carpets in the hallway have a lot of stains and it is in general not that nice. The housekeeping will not respect if you don't want them to come into the room - they will enter anyway - even if the sign is up and they do not keep their hands to themselves. I had several items thrown out which was not in the trash or meant to be thrown out. Also, the hotel has a lot of ants inside the room, when we complained we were told that an employee would come up and spray the room but as we looked further we could see that the ants were in EVERY nook and cranny on the tables and in the bed. We were so frustrated that the hotel would only spray the room that we managed to get a new room instead. This room had the same condition as the old one, but only one ant was visible. The employee threw us quite an attitude but sprayed the room down and promised us there would be no ants but within 4 days they were crawling on the walls there as well.PLUSSES:The location, which is quite nice and close to the red line Metro plus several busses.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"Stayed in room 112, noticed right away that the bathroom needed some work. Attempted unsuccessfully to cancel our reservation. A closer inspection revealed very small ANTS in the bathroom! Because the lights in the bathroom were bright you could easily see them, that was not the case in the rest of the room. I have no idea if they were anywhere else. The bathroom was in need of repair. The bottom of the door was rotting, tiling, grouting and caulking needed to be done. Even the TV connection was poor. We stayed the night and requested a room change in the morning. The staff was very accommodating, and didn't charge us for parking for our 2 nights. The next room, 123, looked much better. The TV worked properly, the bathroom looked better. Unfortunately, if you spent any time in the bathroom you again encountered ANTS! Very small ants like in the other room. At checkout we brought it up again, no compensation was given. The staff acted surprised but there was no way that they were not aware of the situation. This hotel was not cheap, I expected more. They never asked for me to point out the problem so I expect that the rooms were just given to other unsuspecting guests without addressing the issues.","Dear Guest,Sorry to hear the issue you experienced while staying with us.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"Now this is the second time I have stayed at this hotel. The first time was 3 1/2 years ago, and we had a great time. Rates were less than a $100, and they gave us huge renovated clean rooms.This time, we paid almost 3 times what we paid last time, and our family of 4 got a small recently renovated room on the ground floor overlooking the parking lot. My Indian parents got a smaller, older room, with an incredibly tiny non-renovated bathroom for the same price. We had two mosquitoes in our room, and I spent 30 mins trying to kill them, with thoughts of Zika and West Nile viruses in my head. Next day, I complained at the Front desk, and they said they would send someone to spray something and get rid of the mosquitoes, but non-one came, and we still had them in our room the second night. The pool was filthy, and filled with dead wasps and debris. And when we checked out, my 85-year old Dad told me that they charged him $54 dollars for pay-per-view. According to the hotel, my Indian Dad who has never heard of Marvel, watched ""Avengers: Infinity War"" when we were out at night having dinner. Showing the Front Desk our dinner receipt didn't help, as they did not even want to look at it. And apparently, the next morning, at 7 am , he watched the same movie for 19 mins and was charged $21.99 for it. Despite my Father's denial that he watched any such movie, the Manager would not budge. We were celebrating my Dad's 85th birthday, and this totally ruined our experience. Whatever happened, the hotel could have been gracious and removed the charges, but apparently we were not important enough. When I complained about the mosquitoes, the Manager said that they were just part of the local wildlife. I didn't know LA is part of a jungle environment. Maybe the fact that we were Indian contributed to our shoddy treatment. We are never going to stay at this hotel again. A lot more hotels to be found at the exorbitant prices we paid.To be fair, the Breakfast Buffet is excellent, and was the highlight of our stay.","Dear Tina,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"After booking this hotel I was excited to arrive. Upon arrival we were very shocked. First of all I have traveled all over the world and I have over seven years of experience in hospitality. In all of these experiences I have never ever once had my personal ID scanned and printed for the hotel to keep. When I questioned as to why they took photocopies of IDs. I did not get a straight answer the front office agent, who replied “all hotels in LA do this. “ well first of all this is untrue. I work in a five star hotel in California and have stayed in Multiple hotels in LA and not one of them have ever scanned and copied my ID. This is something you should stop immediately. What are you doing with our personal information once we check out? Why are you keeping a piece of paper of guests IDs when ANY employee has access to this information... I understand having to show your ID but taking a copy is unethical. When a guest is concerned and refusing you to make a copy of this card. They have the right to do so. You cannot deny access to a hotel room until you take a photo copy of their personal ID. VERY BAD business practice. In addition to this issue, the hotel you can tell is currently under going construction and I can definitely see the potential for this hotel however, you sure have photoshopped ALL of your photos to the point it is an unrealistic representation of your property. Our bathroom tiles were cracked and bathroom dirty. The beds extremely comfortable and the pillows must have cost the hotel a $1 a piece. Worst nights sleep. For the cost the hotel it isn’t a horrible property. Like I said they have potential.

Parking was $26, way over priced and not included in the prepay price.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to review The Hollywood Hotel. I'm very sorry to hear about your disappointment.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"My husband and I were staying for our anniversary I work at the inn at the cove and I am a manger ,also my husband is law enforcement, so I know how hotels run .When I checked in the front desk lady was nice and everything was nice. I checked into the room and it had been recently remolded. The hotel itself was very nice, the beds are a little to hard and the street noise keep me up all night. That is fine because I know that is not the hotels fault. After checking out we went to universal studios and we received a phone call from the front desk manger explaining that there were two robes missing from the room and that they were charging our card. When we checked in there were no robes in the room, I was not even aware that they had robes. When I tried to explain this to the front desk manger she just kept repeating herself and being very dismissive, not even listing. She said housekeeping keeps a log of the robes, which is a good idea if this was being done properly, and she informed us that she is charging our card for the missing robes Housekeeping dropped the ball on this and I feel very violated of my integrity and my money. There mistake is costing me 189 dollars which I think is very wrong and bad customer service. I don't think anybody would be this upset if they had actually stole the robes'! I should be reimbursed and get an apology. I don't want to put the hotel down for the bad employees ,but if this is the way you want to run your business then I would be very cautious of what is in your room before you check in so you want be charged .",Dear Guest...Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback regarding your recent stay at our hotel.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"My husband and I stayed at the hotel, and on returning to the hotel for the night, while getting ready for bed, we discovered that my retainer was not in the bathroom where I left it - in a cup soaking, as I had done every night of our stay. It’s worth at least $250; who knows what it costs in California to replace. It’s not easily replaced. We just moved here. I don’t have an orthodontist here. Bobby was rude. Martin? couldn’t be bothered. Both refused to do anything claiming we had to talk to the daytime manager - I needed my medical appliance that night. The longer we waited, the more likely it would be unable to find. They claimed there was no night manager. I asked who they would call if they had a problem; apparently no one, which makes this an unsafe hotel. No one is in charge.To top it off, no cups replaced the ones that were taken. No soap was replaced.What in the world was their staff thinking? They wouldn’t even let me make a claim. Bobby, who wouldn’t make eye contact or talk to me, laughed at me and told me from across the room to file a claim with my insurance company? What insurance company - it’s their damn hotel. I don’t insure against their negligence.I stay in hotels regularly, never once has any staff touched my retainer or anything that I was using, like a cup.I’m so angry and it’s going to cause me serious problems that will out value $250. What’s the cost of new braces to put my teeth back in place? The headaches caused by grinding my teeth? A broken tooth that the retainer protected against? The embarrassment of that? Lost time at my new job.Do not come here. Tons of hotels in L.A.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"The only positive I can describe about this hotel is the beds that were very big and comfy.Cons:- The area is awful, rough, scary, whatever you want to call it, very unsafe. When we checked in a junkie from the street made their way into the lobby screaming which was very unsettling.- The receptionist Gisele had a bad attitude, bearing in mind we're British tourists who had never been to America/LA and simply asked if the Subway was safe to use she went on the defence immediately for some reason and was also very snappy and unhelpful about explaining the deposit. There seems to be a lot of bad reviews about her particularly on here, lose the attitude, it doesn't look good.- Beautiful view from our room of a 'family clinic'...- Small pool which is next to the car park and all you can hear is the LA traffic.- Nothing to do in the area, if you want snacks you have to go to the gas station which is as far as we would walk in this area.- There is public transport in this area but wouldn't recommend taking it is as its unsafe.- The hotel is far from actual Hollywood and West Hollywood which is a much nicer area, I would recommend paying extra to stay in WeHo/sunset strip or even santa monica area, anywhere would be better than here- Breakfast was mediocre, yes there was a chef who made omelettes but 90% of the food was buffet style and not great.I really do hope I've made someone make a better informed decision on where to stay in LA because this hotel/staff/area ruined our time in LA, such a shame.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"I was going to stay for a few nights, but checked out after the first one.First of all... Hollywood is NOT a beautiful part of LA. There is a ton of crime, and most of the areas around the tourist attractions are filled with drug addicts, homeless people and hoodlums. The ""attractions"" are absolute rip offs.I didn't come for that, was just hoping to have a nice place to stay while visiting family in the area.On check in, you are asked to approve a deposit to cover ""incidentals"". The pool is located out the back door and across the parking lot. There are some lounge chair there, but it is not really the relaxing place they make it appear to be.The room was grimey, as were the hallways. The breakfast, despite some reviews, was very average, and the omelette chef did not act friendly at all. The eggs in my omelette were not even cooked, there was pale yellow runny stuff all over my plate. I didn't eat it.Hotels are so expensive in LA, but if you're going to have to pay, I'd recommend go downtown, and stay at one of the chain hotels.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"I will put this as one of the worst hotel stays in my lifetime. This dump is literally a small notch above a hotel/motel located in a third world country.Let's start off with the misleading booking of the room. Not at any point in my conversation with the agent was it disclosed that there was an additional $26.00 charge for parking in there lot. I was not happy about this. I get into the room and the A/C is on full blast in the month of December with the temp being in the 50's. I called the front desk staff and asked them how to adjust the temp, was told they would send someone right up, no one ever showed up. Avoid any room facing the main road as you will hear ambulances and street traffic the entire night. Finally wake up to hopefully enjoy a nice hot shower. Towels provided were thinned out and overused ready to be retired as rags. Hot water temp was maybe at best a luke warm with an outdated shower and limestone clogged shower head. Since I was already freezing from the room being in the 50's this was not pleasant.The real downer and what will put the the nail in the coffin was checking out in the morning when I went to go check out. I explained to the woman at the counter the issues I faced and asked why no one showed up after my call to the front desk. Her only response was ""I don't know"" with a smirk on her face.WARNING! Spend your money $ elsewhere and avoid The Hollywood Hotel! This place is outdated, horrible uncomfortable rooms and just a complete waste of money.","Dear Guest...Thank you for taking the time to share your comments with us.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"The Hotel is a 'surprise', a pleasant surprise, due in part to the area around it.First the hotel: It is nicely maintained. The rooms, while not overly large (and there's no closet) more than met our needs. The hotel was quiet and there was a full breakfast complete with omelette station included with the room due, and the dining area is really nice.But, be prepared, the area around the hotel, while not bad, is also not particularly glamorous. That great photo of the 'entrance' is not the street view of the hotel, but from the Parking Lot (or course, once you check in, you do enter via the parking lot.We were taking in a show at the Pantages, and this was a convenient stay. I guess, that's the key here, it's a great place to stay, you will be driving to the areas you actually want to visit. (I guess that's LA). Would I stay there again?

Hollywood Hotel,20,"We expected better quality at the Hollywood Hotel, judging by the photos. Instead, it was fairly mediocre across the board. On the positive, the breakfast was pretty good, with a chef making waffles, pancakes, omelettes etc. The pool area was small, a bit out of the way, but ‘ok’ for our needs. The room was quiet and clean, but the housekeeping was appalling. Early one morning, we were badgered by the cleaning lady to get out of our room because she was waiting to clean it. We were on our way out for the day anyway, so wasn’t too disturbed by it. But then the second day we came back to the room late at night to find it hadn’t been cleaned or made up at all. Our son’s bed had no sheets on it and dirty towels were still piled up in the bathroom. To try and get someone to come and make up all the beds and change the towels seemed like a monumental task. Only when my husband dumped all the towels down in the lobby did they send somebody up to attend to the issue. When you’ve been out all day, the last thing you want to come back to, as a guest, is an unmade bed and dirty towels. And last time I checked, besides a bed to sleep in, daily service is what you pay a hotel for?And lastly, the area where the hotel is located seems pretty dodgy.....we weren’t comfortable walking around the area at all and it’s not family friendly. Quite a few homeless people/ beggars on the sidewalks. Also, it’s a bit of a drive in traffic to the actual ‘Hollywood’ tourist area and is a short drive to Universal Studios.",Dear Guest...Thank you for sharing your feedback with us.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"The place is in an unsafe location. Before checking in, outside the hotel we heard a commotion in a place that was close by where a guy ran with a knife chasing another person. We didn't want to check in given the location and were willing to pay one night's rate to cancel the reservation, but Gisele was extremely rude and said that they will not refund our money. Her attitude was very bad. I cant believe this exists in a hospitality industry. Also, we hadn't even checked in.We had booked for 3 nights and the total was close to $350.

Hollywood Hotel,20,"Booked this hotel based on the four star rating, but it was immediately apparent from the less-than-inspiring foyer with wonky lowered plastic tiled roof and scuffed and battered walls and furniture that we were in three star or below territory. Room was large but at the front of the hotel and the aircon had to be cranked up to the crazy loud top fan rating to drown out the road noise. Pluses - most of the cruddy old carpet has been ripped out and replaced by laminated board flooring, doors are heavy and have card security, good to have a safe in room. Pool area is quite nice but on the far side of the carpark. Breakfast had a reasonable range but staff were rather rude. While walking through the breakfast room with my empty plate a staffer called after me loudly 'Where are you going?"" and, when told I was putting my plate on the collection trolley, waved his hand impatiently and grunted I should put my plate on the trolley he was pushing around the breakfast room (which was already making it difficult for guests to move around - why not put the trolley in a less busy area and walk the dishes over, using a tub for collection if necessary?). Forget service with a smile, everyone who worked there seemed to be dialling it in rather than genuinely enjoying their jobs and interacting with guests.While the main photo promoting the hotel is by the steps in the back car park and is is no reflection of the overall quality of the hotel. There were ants in our room so it was impossible to put food anywhere other than in the fridge. The bathroom had chipped tiles and peeling paint. While it's close to the subway and there's a hospital nearby, the location is in a seedy part of town and not the glamorous Hollywood implied in publicity materials. Staff kept more than a dozen guests waiting in the foyer from 2pm to past the 3pm checkin time while they did 'handover', when clearly rooms were available and the backlog could have been cleared by checking in some guests slightly earlier. Hotel has seen much better days, was clearly quite upmarket 20 years ago but has only been updated in a slapdash fashion since. Worse, the car park area was resurfaced on a very hot day and cordoned off so guests could not access the pool. There was no notice to this to guests in signage or messages at checkin and staff appeared indifferent to the inconvenience this caused.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

The mini refrigerator was turned on but wasn't cold. There was a metal cover on the ceiling of the shower that was rusting. The room definitely needed to be refurbished.

Hollywood Hotel,10,"On 19/07/2017 I booked this hotel for 3 nights (after we were let down by Airbnb with the host cancelling our stay 3 days before we were due to arrive there) through Agoda ( reservation number 202863187) and paid in full 656.90 dollars (I was charged £503.52 on 20/07).When we got to the hotel on 22/07 I realised we had a big queen size bed for the three of us and asked if they could upgrade us; unfortunately they did not have a bigger room (with two double beds). They offered me a folding bed but I said no: I felt the price they quoted me for the bed was too high, especially considering that those beds are rubbish anyway.Internet and breakfast were included. I left the rental car on the road outside, paying the meter when I had to and I didn't use their garage.When I checked out they said there was nothing to pay and in fact there should have not been.On receiving my credit card statement I then noticed I was charged 130.80 dollars possibly on the day I left (the charge appears on my statement on 27/07/2017). For what if I did not use any other services? It should have not been for the bed we never got (they should have charged me on the day we arrived I suppose) and everything else I had paid up front for.I have contacted Agoda (they have been excellent) and through them I have sent 3 emails to the hotel. They have not even had the decency to reply.Not only we did not sleep well, I was overcharged and finished paying for a service I did not get. It's not for the money I spent plenty in the States (travelling with two children), it is for the principle.It suffices to say I’d never use this place again. This might have originally been an honest mistake but I invite fellow travellers to be careful on departure and always check the bill.",Dear GuestThank you for reviewing your recent stay with us at Hollywood Hotel on TripAdvisor.I’m very sorry to hear that we were unable to fully meet your expectations and deliver the service we are known for during your time with us in Hollywood.Your feedback has been shared with management .

Hollywood Hotel,30,"This is a basic three star hotel (towards the lower end of the 3 star range). I personally do not know how people would give it 4 or 5 stars.The hotel is a renovated Ramada Inn, located in an older area of Hollywood, that has seen better days. The area is not the prettiest, but is far from dangerous. It is the commercial strip of a working class/immigrant section. There are some homeless people, but that has been an unfortunate trend all over Los Angeles (and the country) as of late.The hotel is pretty centrally located, basically within 30 minutes of anywhere you would want to go as a tourist (except Disneyland, which is actually in Anaheim in Orange County, about an hour away). The Walk of Fame in Hollywood, Rodeo Drive Venice Beach, Santa Monica, Malibu, Melrose Avenue, etc., are all 30 minutes or less away. I lived in Los Angeles for a while, so I know the layout of the city, and the location was a definite plus.The hotel is a little odd, as the furnishing from one room to another seem to vary greatly (from what I could see of other rooms when the doors were opened while the maid was cleaning it), ranging from somewhat tired looking hotel furnishings, to new ones.We were given a room with two queen beds that was described as one of their larger rooms. It was pretty small, by modern hotel standards, but did the job. However, I would hate to see what they consider a small room...The rooms were clean, the bathroom was clean, the halls were newly renovated and clean. The common areas were perfectly nice. There is gated parking for about $27/day, which seems to be the standard for the LA area.There were a couple of things that were a little off-putting.First was the shower, specifically the shower-head. The bathtub was actually raised off the floor, as if it was built on a step. So getting out of the bathtub/shower, the step down was pretty far, and I am 6'2"" and saying that. Also, the shower head was placed on the wall where it should have been if the tub portion was level with the rest of the bathroom floor. I am not sure if I am explaining that well, but suffice to say the shower head was about 8"" lower on the wall than you would expect it to be. I have no explanation for this, and it was annoying, but nothing more. The bathroom also showed a little sign of extended use around the edges, mostly in the ceiling are above the tub. Of course since I literally had to duck to take a shower, I was probably closer to the ceiling than I normally would have been, and nothing a quick paint job with mildew resistant paint could not fix.The elevators are painfully slow. We were on the second floor, so we took the stairs more often than not. Plus the floor indicator light is out on at least one of them, and I may me mistaken, but I think the inspection certificate is also expired. But they are newly renovated, not crummy or anything like that.The breakfast buffet, and I use that term loosely, is included. Personally I found the whole omelette station that people seem to rave about kind of annoying. An omelette station may be a nice addition to a buffet, but if you want any eggs, you have to see the omelettes guy. And if you are like me, and aren't the biggest fan of omelettes and want something exotic, like say basic scrambled eggs, the guy will give you major attitude, and make you wait off to the side for an extra couple of minutes, to let you know who is the boss I guess. He sort of reminded me of the soup guy on Seinfeld.Other than omelettes, they have the usual cereal, fruit, bagels, toast, orange juice, coffee, etc. They also have covered trays of some rather cheap tasting sausage and hash browns. It would seem to make more sense to have a tray of scrambled eggs, as opposed to waiting in line for an omelette, or waiting in the corner near the line, for the omelette-meister to get around to your scrambled eggs. Also, I have never seen sausages without bacon.The coffee was actually surprisingly good however.I cannot comment on effectiveness of the hotel staff, other than to say they were perfectly nice, and checked us in without issue and our rooms were always made up when we got back from wherever we went for the day. Our stay was uneventful so we really had no interaction with them beyond that.The pool is nice, and is in a gated area off the parking lot. It is secluded, but is just a pool with some furniture around it. The only thing is that it supposedly closed at 8 PM, which is early. However, we did see people sitting out there until at least 10 PM. There was no poolside service, but you can get a bottle of wine at the store across the street and sit around with some friends without issue. I am not sure if it was because the hotel staff didn't notice, or didn't care. Either one is possible.In defense of the hotel, I read a few reviews by people complaining of musty smells in the hallways and around various areas of the hotel. I smelled it too, it wasn't musty, it was marijuana. Marijuana is legal in California, and is sold at the retail level at numerous stores all over the city, in fancy and not so fancy areas. In fact my 14 year old daughter opined there were more pot stores than Starbucks. You will smell this all over town, not just in and around this hotel.Also, I saw a picture of a squashed cockroach prominently displayed with one review. Cockroaches are my Achilles' heel, so I was on guard after seeing that. I did not see one roach, and believe me I was looking. The place is quite clean. Also, I don't think that picture is of a cockroach but a Palmetto Bug, one of those nasty flying roaches from the tropics, which they also have (in smaller numbers than the tropics) in LA.Overall it is a no-service hotel that is more like a motel. There is no room service, but being in the middle of Hollywood, and with all the app based delivery services around, you don't need it. Also, if you want drinks by the pool, you have to bring your own.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Hollywood Hotel,30,"Booked this hotel very last minute after going through a couple of reviews, the hotel itself is located on the outskirts of Hollywood , but when I say Its conveniently located I mean it's easy to get to most places from here, cos it's 10mins drive from downtown as well as central Hollywood , so it's like somewhat in the centre of both , 6-7min drive from sunset strip...The rooms are clean and beds are comfortable , the AC is a bit noisy and may turn off at night , but once you inform the reception bout it they change the settings and have it on.The breakfast is very average, just had it for one dayThe front desk staff can be more courteous, we were checked out by someone named Gisel, who didn't come across as very friendly.All in all it's a good option for the price your paying as it's conveniently located to get to either DTLA or H'wood.","Dear Guest,Thank you for the great review of our hotel!

Hollywood Hotel,10,"Not recommended. Booked this room through Expedia and feel completely disappointed and scammed. The facility is in complete disrepair with some random updates throughout. The first night the water pipes inside bathroom wall burst @ 3am flooding the room. The next day I asked to speak with the manager about the incident. The desk clerk was rude and refused to reimburse any charges. She advised me that they had taken care of me by moving me to a new room (really?!). She also told me that my parking fees would be comped for the inconvenience, however I was still billed at checkout. The parking lot would have been secure but the automatic gate was either broken or out of tickets every time we went in/out. The phone in both rooms did not function.

Hotel June,10,"I've definitely stayed at worse hotels, however I wish that my stay here would have been much better. on the trip advisor website parking says $22 per night however upon pulling up it's valet only and $50 a night. Therefore I was not about to pay $100 for a weekend of parking when I could park on the street for free only 20 ft away. Upon check-in they charge $75 deposit per night for any incidents that may occur during the stay but I was not advised that through TripAdvisor. The first thing that I saw in our hotel room was silverfish bugs in our sheets and I threw up the sheets thinking that the room would be clean when we left for the day and came back to go back to sleep at night. However, the room was never cleaned even though I put a yes sign on the door after we left for the day. The thing that irked me most is that I paid almost $800 for a weekend staywhen across the street literally across the street there were rows and rows of homeless people in tents, I think they are the real winners here. They had a pretty cool pool area with the restaurant however they closed the pool quite early for a party of some sort I'm guessing and we tried to eat at the hotel but it was reservation only and dinner started at 10:00 p.m. which was far too late for us so we ended up Uber eating. Our room was straight across from the elevator so it was extremely loud people laughing screaming at all times the night because they were right next to our door trying to get downstairs..The only good thing I can say about our stay here is that there was a Starbucks literally right behind the hotel at the Ralph's grocery store.

Hotel June,20,"Got a great deal for a 1 night stay with friends. We were excited to have a break from LA and use the pool. We called in advance and they said there were no limitations with the pool. First issue is you can’t contact the front desk. The phone number to call takes forever to contact a human, and the people you talk to don’t actually work at the hotel nor can they ever seem to reach the front desk. On top of it, no one has the right answer, even when you arrive. We got here for an early check in and parking was insane ($46 for valet, $35 for self park- we parked for free around the corner on the street). We checked in and they made no mention of all of the wait times. Once we got settled in, we went down to the pool only to find out the waitlist was 18 parties and we were told to go to the bar. We got to the bar, and the wait was an hour. Our only option was to get to go drinks from the bar in the lobby where a couple was complaining to management about how poorly the hotel is being run. We finally got seated at the restaurant which was actually very pleasant with good food and drinks. We continued to check in at the pool to see our wait time but the women working there kept ignoring us and refused to answer our questions. Overall, a really frustrating and bad experience for a hotel that has so much potential.","Haleyg917,Thank you very much for taking the time to share your comments regarding your stay at Hotel June.Exceptional service is what we strive to be known for; therefore, your feedback is extremely important as it helps us to continually improve our service and provide a memorable experience to our valued guests.Please allow me to express my sincerest apologies.

Hotel Erwin,30,"First off, Miguel was amazing. He deserves credit where credit is due. Secondly, the manager did attempt to make up for the lack of sleep. But, the fact is we did not sleep a single second, therefore no credit makes up for it. Completely up front and honest, we price matched and was able to get the ocean view room for a great price, that was the winner that got us to stay at this hotel. Great location, hands down. But, we met our neighbor, cool guy who said he was headed to the penthouse loft. Little did we know that he was going to pace back and forth all night long and sounded like he was marching in a parade. Called the front desk who said they would call security. Well, that didn’t change a thing. Originally we requested a late check out thinking we would have a great night and want to sleep in. Nope, we were gone by 9 am and wished we would have stayed home. Back to Miguel, besides being a Rams fan ;) he was the best part of our visit. Other than that, we would rather stay home. Which really sucks because we really would have loved to make that a new weekend getaway spot because of the area. Bummer.","Thank you for the great feedback on Miguel!

Hotel Erwin,20,"Hate to write a bad review as staff were friendly but our experience was disappointing. To be honest we found one particular staff member really over the top and made us feel slightly uncomfortable, we are young and we enjoy a laugh but having a staff member call someone a s*ut during their first sentence to us was a bit much and really set the tone for the stay. We were told we were upgraded to the 2nd best room which really shocks me as the room felt like an expensive hostel, the whole hotel did to be honest, dark corridor and our room was small, bathroom dirty, it was the balcony which saved the room.Our nightmare experience started in the evening as we were trying to relax and get some rest, at about 9.30pm we heard a man right outside our balcony swearing and shouting, they have a rooftop bar right above us. you can't hear when in the room but this man must have climbed down the stairs and was right outside our window, swearing really loudly and speaking disgustingly, they were also smoking weed outside the window which was coming through and stinking out our room. I don't care what people do or say in their own time but it was really horrible to have it effect us.I called down after 20 minutes and was told security would go up to sort it out, 10 minutes later and finally it stopped, but of course we still had the horrible smell. It was just really disappointing this happened, no apology was given and it really tainted our stay, I have a video of the disgusting language outside our window.

Hotel Erwin,30,Great room. Although our AC was broken for half our stay. Great staff with High standards.

Hotel Erwin,30,"This was our 4th stay as a family in the Hotel Erwin so, as you can probably guess we really love the total package of location, facility, services etc.This stay was really interesting, there are alterations being made with some associated mess and noise however this was being carried out really well and the impact on our stay was minimised.The room facilities were again really good with fittings of a good standard and nice touches in a family room like board games etc around.Everything was clean and well presented.We had only one gripe and unfortunately it was a big one. We had booked a 1 bedroom suite with a bed and a pull out sofa bed for a family of 4. The bed was fantastic.The pull out sofa bed was not! It was litterally the worst bed we have ever been presented with. It had a thin mattress with springs poking through. We were unable to sleep on it and ended up folding it away and making up beds on the couches.We raised this with reception in the morning and their response was very good. They offered a couple of solutions including a move to a two bedroom unit. As we were really tired and unpacked we took the roll away bed option so that we did not have to pack and move.The roll away bed was better but not great but this was our choice.For a place that is aiming for the standards they are and that achieves it in all other aspects the standard of bed for the sofa bed was really disappointing and they should do better. Particularly given the price charged for a genuine 4 person room option.Overall the lasting impression of great location, fantastic service and good facilities was marred by this issue.","Thank you for reviewing your experience at Hotel Erwin. I am happy to hear that you have stayed with us multiple times and had great service experiences, but it disappoints me that your most recent visit was marred by an issue with the sofa bed.

Hotel Erwin,30,The hotel is currently under construction in the foyer which we were not aware of. There is no ramp for strollers or wheelchairs because of this.The room was a nice size. The bathroom was tiny however and the sink was in the main room. We had booked a cot for our son but had to chase this several times before it arrived. The view was a car park so not great. We were offered a free continental breakfast because of all the work going on which was a nice gesture but not much to eat. Staff were ok not overly friendly but not rude.

Hotel Erwin,30,"We loved almost everything about thi hotel. We chose the epic view room and were on the top floor. The view was stellar. The bed is so comfortable that I want to know what mattress topper they use. It gets 5 stars on everything except the noise. Street noise does not bother me at all. However, on Friday night we were kept awake by the noise of thier nightclub. We loved the rooftop, and had cocktails at sunset there. The noise that kept us up until after well after midnight was not acceptable in a room we paid a premium for. We called the desk, and they sent security up. Security came to our door, could clearly hear the booming of the speakers that are set against the upper windows to our floor, and said they would tell them to turn it down, and that they have to stop by midnight. They did not stop by midnight. They did stop before 1am. There were two a $16 breakfast coupons under our door in the am to make it up to us. Nicely done. That night, we were back in our room listening to the pounding bass from upstairs. I suffered through it, because my husband was not feeling well, and moving is a huge pain. I was there three nights. I had unpacked and hung all my things (there are no drawers, I hung everything). I did not want to have to pack everything up at midnight to be moved to another room, just to have to reload it all in the morning to head home. As we were checking out, the lady at the desk asked how our stay was. What happened next is what is still troubling me. I said ""yes, we loved it, but we were on the top floor and the nightclub noise is really loud, you might want to let people know about that so they can decide if the noise will bother them before they book the top floor."" That was it. That was all I said. The employee came back, very short, with this ""Well, you should have said something at the time, we would have moved you instantly."" First off, I had. Next, I explained already that moving at midnight is not fun. It is not a piece of cake, or a simple thing, to the people who are in the room. That was not what I had asked about. I had not asked them to apologize, to make it right, to give me anything at all, I had simply suggested that there are people (even myself at times) who are night owls and would either be up there joining the fun, or out somewhere else, who would not mind the noise, but that people should be warned about the volume so they could decide before midnight when they are already in bed for the night. I did not need to be told that I had failed in some way to make myself comfortable. I paid somewhere in the neighborhood of $1,300.00, all in, over three nights. I should not have to flee my room in the dead of night, due to noise, in order to be able to sleep. Fleeing your room should never be the answer to hotel bar noise at midnight. And I certainly should not be reprimanded by the front desk for not being thrilled to pack and move in the middle of the night. I have asked them again, to do something for other travelers in the future to avoid this. We were in room 610, and the noise is such that one cannot sleep through it. It is a shame, because this place is stunning.","Thank you for taking the time to share your experience. I am very sorry that you were inconvenienced by the music and that when going over your concerns we failed to show the sympathy and understanding that was appropriate to the situation.

Hotel Erwin,30,"In either case, Erwin failed on this day. As a hotel guest, I would expect the facilities would be made available. Barlow restaurant unexpectedly closed and no availability on rooftop sit down food & beverage. Hostess on rooftop indicated that all the lounge tables were 'reserved' at 3 pm. We arrived at 1:00 PM. Ordered drinks and food from a surly barkeep and waited forever for the food - 40 minutes for 3 sliders and 2 street tacos. I ate standing next to a pole and had to put our drinks on the floor to hold the food. My second and last visit to this establishment. Set the bar really low and you won't be disappointed. BTW, the hotel does benefit from a great location however I can't say much more from a positive POV.","I was extremely disappointed to read about your experience at High, there is no excuse for a surly bartender or poor service.

Hotel Erwin,10,"Let me preface this by saying I have never written a review before but after my stay here I felt like I had to share. I was on a work trip in la for about a month and was in and out of this hotel during that time.I arrived to the hotel at 3 am after my flight was delayed with two suitcases and the person sitting on the front desk couldn't stand up from doing nothing to give me a hand with my bags-let alone open the doors.The rooms here are nothing special. My shower had no hot water or pressure even after I called the front desk and was assured they'd fix it. I also couldn't find a fridge in my room and I asked one of the employees and they told me there wasn't one. A week later when I was rechecking into the hotel I found out that every room has a fridge they just forgot to give me a key.My company had made two reservations back to back at the Erwin so I had requested that I stay in the same room which seemed to be no problem at all. When I left for work the next morning they called me telling me that I had to get out of that room causing a huge inconvenience.I had a car for a couple of days that I parked in their lot never being told that I would be charged $42 a night until my last night there. How do you not tell your guests that they have to pay for parking?? The lady at the front desk assumed I knew there was a fee because every place in la has a fee.....I'm clearly not from la that's why I'm staying at the hotel.I hated staying here. The staff made me feel insignificant (I had been staying here for 3 weeks and every time I tried to go to my room the same guy asked to see my key to make sure I was a guest) no one ever offered to help with my bags, they were too busy on their cell phones. Also the bar upstairs is a joke. Get ready to listen to the worst music, watch girls take selfies, and pay waaaaaay to much for food and drinks. And don't bother sitting down in one of the many empty tables, you will be asked to move in the least polite way.","We were very disappointed to see that you did not enjoy your stay, but reading your comments we can understand your concerns.

Hotel Erwin,20,I was supposed to spend two nights here but ended up with only one. The hotels main focus is clearly the roof top bar - everything seems to evolve around this. When arriving with bags the valet guys dis not even hold up the door. The foyer was crowded with people waiting for the elevator. Once in the sea view room (not much of a view through the small dirty window facing the beach) and the rooms standard... more like a spring break than an expensive hotel. I also tried to contact the hotels concierge some days peior to arrival but that is a concept that they seem to be missing... But have to admit the staff in the reception was great when we left. I regret not staying at the Venice Breeze (stayed there in march) but really regret checking out of WoHo. We returned for WeHo for one more night.,"Thank you for giving us a try.

Hotel Erwin,20,"I'll start by saying if I can rate the entire review based on my front desk service from Miguel who BTW is Awesome I would give 5 stars. He was the best. Very informative and super friendly. A+ for Miguel!Checked in on a Friday in August 2016, the room was nice with a great ocean view. location of the Hotel is great, awesome for walking down the Board Walk, renting bikes and for getting to the Beach.The not so Great. Woke up Saturday morning 7:45 AM to annoying loud jackhammer construction from a Neighboring Building. I understand that's out of the Hotels hands but it was so early, so loud and a total inconvenience for the high price of $457 per night. Their ""Famous"" Rooftop was closed for a private event for the night that we checked in, huge reason we stayed there was to enjoy a Sunset and a few cocktails on their rooftop that night of our vacation, had to make plans elsewhere. Day 2, after being woken up to the construction we Bought a Pot of Coffee from their downstairs Restaurant and a juice from next door and decided to finally enjoy a drink on the Roof top, which apparently is not open seating, the Employee who greated us at the Host stand to ID check us was so rude with such a negative attitude and then after wristbanding us says sorry you can't bring any beverages up here... It was Coffee from the Hotel, a bottled water from the Hotel and a Health Juice. It was 9am no one was upstairs and he basically said go back to your room and come upstairs later. It seems this Hotel only cares about making money from its beachfront ish property without caring about the guests and their experience.All in all Venice / Santa Monica area is really not worth your time to stay and visit while in California, you have Nicer beaches South and for the price Hotel Erwin is asking you can do much much better elsewhere including Orange County. Venice was surrounded by a big homeless population, people pedaling drugs and bums begging for Money. Do yourself and your family a favor and please visit another beach town, Malibu, Hermosa, Seal Beach, Huntington, Newport, Laguna, any Beaches, South or North of Venice /Santa Monica.","Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel and your kind words about Miguel.

Hotel Erwin,30,"On the plus side, the staff was very courteous and helpful. One of the managers gave us a fabulous recommendation to a great restaurant (Sol Cocina) and one of the registration clerks allowed us to check-out early with no penalty fee. You can't get much closer to the beach, although the proximity comes with qualifications.On the negative side, the hotel is pretty worn. The carpet looked like it was a few years past its prime and the overall condition of the property is clean but old. Venice Beach itself is pretty seedy and the Hotel Erwin is ground zero. As you can see from the picture, our ""ocean view"" room actually faces an alley and parking lot. You get constant traffic and activity, so if you're looking for peace and quiet this isn't the place for you (the picture was taken at 6:30 a.m. which is why it's pretty deserted). On a Monday morning we counted no less than 5 garbage trucks roll through the area. Combine that with the vagrants combing through the trash cans and you have a wonderful beach ambiance.The boardwalk is filled with dingy food places, smoke shops, and cheap souvenir stores. Don't make eye contact or accept anything the numerous street hawkers are trying to sell, even if they nearly stuff it in your hand. I had a guy try to pick a fight with me when I tried to give him back the DVD of his supposed basketball ""highlights"" when I told him I didn't want to buy it.If you're into the grungy beach scene, then Venice Beach is for you. Personally I would recommend just about any of the other beautiful beaches in Southern California. I would also suggest staying in a hotel further inland and drive to the beach. You'll get a better price and a nicer quality hotel. We were scheduled to stay 2 nights but checked out after the first because we wanted to move to a higher quality hotel and better area.","Thank you for taking the time to review the hotel and your kind words on our service. We understand that Venice Beach is not for everyone. It’s an eclectic neighborhood that is definitely not your typical beach town. It has a singular charm with its own unconventional energy and idiosyncrasies that make it one of the most unique places in California. We love the surprises and spontaneity (I for one am very curious about the “basketball highlights” DVD and what was on it), but we understand that some people would rather experience that in small doses.

Hotel Erwin,10,This was the most frustrating hotel experience for me - I dare to say - ever. I will quickly give context by saying that I take about 15 global business trips per year and have experience at hotels around the world. I stayed at the Hotel Erwin for a business trip and this was the best option for me in terms of location. When I checked in the agent at check in went out of his way to tell me that I was being put on the new floor - the newly renovated 6th floor. And it boasted amazing balconies overlooking the Pacific Ocean. The room is fine and the patio is indeed lovely. What they didn't say was that the 6th floor is directly under the rooftop deck. The rooftop deck is also lovely and offers the most amazing views of the sunset. But when you are staying directly under the rooftop bar - it is not a lovely experience. It has a non-stop thumping of bass and you cannot avoid it. The first night I called at 10 pm to the front desk and simply asked when the bar closed. They said 11 pm but they would call the bar to turn it down. They didn't. The second night (tonight) I got home at 9 pm. When I showed up at the hotel there was a sign that a corporate party was taking place. I went to my room and the bass is deafening. I called downstairs and asked if they had earplugs. The front desk person said no. I asked if I could be moved. They said no. I asked what solution they could offer me so that I could actually sleep - they said they could call the bar. 30 minutes later and there is no signs of change to the volume. Based on my years of experience of hotel stays globally I would say that this is likely a great experience for people who are a) on vacation and b) looking to party. I will not choose to stay at Hotel Erwin again.,"Thank you for taking the time to provide feedback on your stay. I apologize that we did not meet your expectations and I can understand your disappointment. The 6th floor is our most popular floor, but you are correct in it can be a little louder than the lower floors due to its proximity to the bar.Clearly our desk staff could have done a better job on finding you a suitable room at the time of check in by giving you more information. I apologize that we did not fully explain your options and offer you the choice of one of our quiet rooms.

Hotel Erwin,30,"The room is big? Yes. It is clean? Yes. It has a nice decoration? It is ok. That being said, it is not really worth it to pay so much for a single night.

It has a nice rooftop bar but unless you make a reservation, you have to stand but there is no decent area to stand, it is just small!

Hotel Erwin,30,"I'd been eyeing The Erwin for a few years, as I like to visit Venice Beach when in LA. So I finally booked a weekend stay. I arrived early and the front desk was very helpful. They were able to upgrade my room to a suite with ocean view. And they handled my luggage and car until I could check in. The suite was nice, quite large, but lags in a few ways. The mini bar is not well stocked, and, I had to call down to have a key sent up. The mini bar had a total of 2 beers!? Corona. And the mini bar area while quite large has ZERO lights. No lights at all. But about 8 light switches?? BIZARRE. Other than that the bed is good, the shower area is nice. Here are my complaints: 1) They didn't make up the room after first night. All they did is restock the bar. I called and they made the bed, and that's it! No towels. No toilet paper!? So I have to rate their housekeeping as VERY poor. Doesn't make me want to rent their suite ever again. 2) The rooftop bar is very nice! Except, the service stunk!! In fact, they treated me very poorly. Told me okay to sit at one location, someone else came said we had to leave. I went and told the manager I'm a guest renting a suite in the hotel! (most weren't guests there). They reluctantly let us sit back down where we had been. Then, no service! When we finally got to order, took forever to get drinks, and then I never got my food! When I asked they laughed, said they accidentally gave it to somebody else. Jerks....I was starving! 30 minutes later it arrives, but no apology! Left when nobody came for more drink orders! On the plus side, the restaurant downstairs is very good...great food and great service. And they treat you like a guest. Maybe they should train the housekeeping and rooftop bar staff!!! Unbelievable. On the last day they had all the alarms going to test the system = OMG how loud/annoying.","Reading about your experience at our rooftop lounge and with the missed housekeeping I can understand, and share, your disappointment. Please accept our apology that you did not receive the service we are known for. We clearly did not meet our expectations on the service levels we want to provide.We do take your feedback very seriously and will use it to improve the hotel experience.When your review was first posted I sent you a message via this website attempting to get more information on you stay.

Hotel Erwin,10,"I just checked in and had I not paid in full via the Hotel Today app (non-refundable) I would have been on my merry way when I saw the room.I'd heard good things from local colleagues about the hotel due to the rooftop bar, but clearly none of them have seen the rooms... There is old and worn down, and then there is dirty. This room is both.I cannot comprehend the high ratings... Maybe I just won the ""special"" room? Upon entering, I was greeted to trash on the floor, hair in the sink and on the floor (the kind you really really don't want to see), old candy on the floor in the closet (perhaps a free snack?), beverage rings on the bathroom counter because it was not wiped down, coffee or some other beverage stains splattered on the wall behind the trash can and the room service paper menu had been dripped on and was curling up. Speaking of which, because I checked in late and missed the room service cut off (it's 9:45pm in case you were wondering) I decided to class it up and dine from the mini bar. Unfortunately many of the mini-bar items seemed like they'd been sitting in the sun all day (ex, a protein bar which I chose not to open was clearly misshapen from having melted, and beef jerky which I did open, regretted and promptly threw away was literally wet). I suspect the drapes were open all day with the sun streaming in on it. Might I suggest rethinking that....There are other joys: The carpet has stains throughout and so do the curtains if you look close enough. One of the pillow cases on the bed should have been retired as it too is stained. And I can hear every movement in the room above me.I was told this was a newish hotel- don't know if that's true, but if so its got an impressive amount of wear and tear. And if was just that, I could deal. But the level of neglect on the part of housekeeping is unacceptable. Shutters on the Beach in Santa Monica this is not, but it's not a hostel either. Especially when I can order the organic beef burger with foie gras and bacon caramel, kale salad, and truffle fries from room service. Actually, no I can't because room service is closed.On the plus side, everyone was nice when I checked in, the minibar m&m's somehow did not melt and are delish, and they have free wifi.","I appreciate you taking the time to outline your experience at the Hotel Erwin and I am so sorry to read of your disappointment. This is not the experience we expect to deliver and I am sincerely apologetic for the inconveniences and hassle you dealt with. Clearly we made a mistake and did not properly inspect your room before we allowed you to check-in.

Hotel Erwin,20,"Could have something to do with arriving on the Sunday night of the Labour Day holiday weekend. Perhaps it's a seaside destination of suntan lotion and sand but the Erwin is simple a little tired and grotty and needs a jolly good clean. Staff are disengaged and over it with everyone looking like they are simply over it and wish they were some place else. My room was fine. Nothing more, nothing less. Breakfast option are super limited with the room being tired and sticky. This kind of sums up Venice in a snapshot. But rather than let itself be dragged down to ordinary, given it's superb location, the Erwin has opportunity to shine. Management needs to rethink the offer. Sorry guys.","Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts on your recent stay and we are disappointed you did not have a wonderful experience.There is no excuse for our staff not making you feel welcome.

Hotel Erwin,20,"I was so excited to visit Hotel Erwin, but I was disappointed to find the rooms VERY small and uneventful. Nonetheless the location is PERFECT to experience Venice Beach and the front desk staff advised us on where to rent bikes. The valets were incredibly rude and one even backed into me as I walked up, knocking me off the sidewalk and instead of apologizing he used profanity exclaiming ""I can't even @#$%* move it's so packed!"". And although the Rooftop Bar is a great attraction to visit, it's unfortunate that they don't have a separate entrance. As hotel guests we had to wait for the elevator to go up 2 times before we could even get on due to all the people in line to get into Rooftop. (I will write a separate review for Rooftop...which we found to be trendy, but a great experience overall!) We also ate breakfast at the hotel restaurant and it was great!","Thank you for taking the time to write this review, but most importantly, thank you for being our guest.

Hotel Erwin,10,"This place was a huge disappointment. The staff is rude and preoccupied with the rooftop bar patrons. The valet and front desk workers were condescending. We watched a valet worker hit on a hotel patron then two hours later act like we were putting him out when we needed the garage door opened.The rooms are nice but not as hip and cool as most LA hotels. Close but no cigar is how I would describe the decor.One good aspect is the parking. Venice is a nightmare so any hotel with parking is worth something.The ""service"" staff were all kind and sweet.

Hotel Erwin,30,"We stayed here after travelling across the USA for several weeks and this was our last destination. Whilst the hotel's decor is modern and the rooms are clean, the area is not very safe. We believe that this hotel justifies its price due to its location on the 'famous' Venice Beach. There are many other nice areas to stay other than on Venice beach which I relate to being similar to a Ghetto. There are also lots of homeless people who live on the beach. Both my wife and I work within Social Care and have been in some tricky situations in our jobs. Being here most definately made us feel uncomfortable and unsafe. The hotel also has a security guard outside who did, on occasions ask for our ID before entering. This evidences how this area is not safe otherwise this wouldn't be necessary. I also witnessed a young girl injecting heroin in a doorway close to the hotel. The hotel has a restaurant which is on the roof top. This restaurant is also open to non residents who are often queueing up outside. This didn't feel particularly nice having lots of people staring at you getting out of the car and returning to the hotel. The room which we were staying in was also very close to the rooftop restaurant and on a couple of nights we got little sleep due to noisy (non residents/residents) who were using the bathrooms (which were on our floor). The manager, however, did move us into a quieter room when we complained about this. The staff were generally friendly and helpful although the hotel is way too expensive for the area in which it is located. After spending time in some lovely hotels during our trip, this one was quite disappointing.","Don,Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts, it was disheartening to read that you had a disappointing experience at our hotel and in the Venice Beach neighborhood. It is doubly disappointing to us that this was your last location on your vacation and you did not enjoy your experience. We try to ensure that our guest feel safe and secure at the hotel, and we apologize if you did not feel that way.The Venice Beach neighborhood and the boardwalk is eclectic and vibrant, it has become famous because of the art and culture that thrive in it. It is not a traditional beach town, and we realize that it may not appeal to everyone. As social workers I am sure you are well aware of the problems facing the less fortunate and the reasons they would be drawn to an area with a large influx of tourism. The hotel works closely with several local charity, government, and community organizations to do our part for those in our neighborhood who are struggling.I was glad to read our staff was able to move you rooms, but I also wanted to let you know that we are addressing the issue with the 5th floor restrooms. We are building new restrooms on the roof and this will eliminate the need for our restaurant guest to travel to the 5th floor for the restroom.Please feel free to contact me directly if you have any additional comments our concerns.Jeff CarpenterGeneral Managerjcarpenter@hotelerwin.com",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: July 2015,"Response from Jeff C, General Manager at Hotel Erwin","Responded Jul 21, 2015"
Hotel Erwin,30,take a bit of a worn out hotel (think it had been a best western??) splash some colourful paint around and pin a surfboard in reception add $$$ to the rates - makes it good right?? No - serviceable only. Big room but didn't bear too much scrutiny - old rattly a/c. The saving grace might have been the roof top bar which they sell hard on but this was closed for a refurb when we were there. You might think its funky if you have never stayed in a funky hotel before which I suspect is the case for many of their guests. Location good though. Too expensive for what it is - a little self deluded in its own description - website made it look fun and hip - not when we were there - perhaps it was us!,"Thank you for taking the time to write this review and for sharing your experience with other travelers that are interested in staying in sunny Venice Beach.

Hotel Erwin,10,"I was out in L.A for a business trip but had a couple of extra days at the end to myself and to enjoy so I decided to look for something really cool and this hotel seemed to fit the bill. As it was only for a couple of nights I opted for an Ocean View Suite which at over £400 per night wasn't cheap but I'm a big fan of ""you get what you pay for"" so I was sure it would be worth it. It wasn't.From the moment I arrived things were just below standard. Check in didn't explain all I wanted to know, didn't offer anything special and no one to help with my bags to the room.Once in the room I was immediately disappointed. It was fairly clean but the walls, curtains, carpet, doors all looked like the could do with a revamp and had seen better days (marked, stained, scratched). Rusty poles in the bathroom, one of the lights didn't work.They did send a complimentary bottle of wine to the room shortly after arriving which was a nice touch but on it's own it was just a wasted idea when it isn't backed up with the main aspects of the hotel (like the room and service)There's a rooftop bar that you can get food at and so I called as soon as I arrived. I was told that they had no tables left (!) but as a guest then I would get priority when one came available so I said fine, I was hungry but I could wait. I asked what time would be the best time to turn up and was advised 8.45pm. So I arrived at 8.30 and introduced myself and was told a table should be free in 5-10 mins. Great.... or so I thought.The bar set up is a near disaster with 2 people trying to service a bar and the table orders and it just wasn't enough. It took about 20 mins to get a 1 drink! I then hung around for another 90mins waiting, and watching as tables became free and then people who were just standing about (like me) sitting in them! I gave up and then saw the lady I spoke to originally and she said that people did just grab tables so me waiting all this time was a total waste of time. What was worse is she said that they don't service food after 8.30 so even if I got a table I couldn't eat anyway!!!! I was lost for words. Total incompetence.Starving I went down to reception and said I was hungry and where could I get food. Without asking what I might like he suggested the Barollo place and SUBWAY! I didn't come here to eat a Subway! A £400/$600 per night room and this was my suggested eating options. Even now I don't know if this hotel offers room service, if they do I don't know about it!Day 2 and I spent most of the day out along Venice Beach/Santa Monica which the hotel is well located for but on returning after a long day at about 4.30pm I found the cleaner still cleaning my room! Again I would expect all this done at breakfast time or late morning but not at 4.30 in the afternoon when I fancied just relaxing in the room but instead had someone hoovering at my feet! I asked reception about this and they said they do room service up till 6pm! Not good.There was a fridge in the room with a mini bar but it froze everything inside solid! so had I wanted a cold beer I couldn't have drunk it anyway! Asked for a late checkout and was told no. Didn't get fresh complimentary water in my room on the 2nd day either. There was soo much more that was wrong here but I simply don't have the patience to write every single issue down. For this money you expect excellence.All in all this would have been a poor experience at £100/$160 per night but at £400/$600 per night it was truly terrible. The hotel states that it tries to 'exceed' customer expectations but it was way short of getting anywhere close to this.","I apologize that you did not have the experience that guest of hotel Erwin have come to expect.

First they had construction right outside our balcony and it was sort of an eye sore( plastic tarps hanging), second we were on the sixth floor which had a great view but was loud on the balcony if the restaurant above was busy.And The last complaint I had was the constant smell of pot. I'm sure this may be a selling point to some but I was so tired of the strong smell of pot on the balcony.We had a beautiful ocean view and it was ruined by the pot smell and the noise from the lounge directly above.I actually started to feel nauseous every time I smelled it it was so strong.I appreciate Venice for what it is, however I was happy to leave the smell.

Hotel Erwin,10,Our suite was $450 a night there is a band blaring next door and our view is of an outhouse and overflowing dumpsters. My (old fashioned) husband made the reservation on the phone for a king bed with a pull out sofa but when I got here they said it was king only and it was $200 more a night for a sofa sleeper room. Our son had a 103 tempature so I really wasn't in the postion to argue or shop around. I just want to go home!!!!,"We apologize for the confusion in your booking.Researching your reservation it appears you booked through a third party reservation site and not directly with the hotel. I confirmed that the third party site that you used does have the correct occupancy for the room and I am not sure why they did not give your husband this information at the time he made the reservation.I know our staff was sympathetic to your situation and did provide a discount of the standard rate for the suite, but I can understand your frustration at having to pay more than expected especially when this was compounded by having a sick child.Again I apologize that your stay started off on the wrong foot and that we did not meet your expectations.Jeff CarpenterGeneral Manager",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: April 2015,"Response from Jeff C, General Manager at Hotel Erwin","Responded Apr 16, 2015"
Hotel Erwin,30,"I had high hopes for The Erwin but really wasn't that impressed. I stayed for x5 nights in March.Everything is fine, but it didn't have the luxurious finishing touches I'd expect from a hotel this expensive. It's obviously pretty hipster, but places like Soho House and The Ace are also catering for a similar crowd and still manage to deliver a really premium experience.Things I liked:Great location, 3 mins from Venice BeachBig, comfy, clean bedGreat showerGreat hairdryerThe roofbar - really nice views over the oceanFree wifi throughoutThings I didn't like:My room - a city view suite, the decor was really tired and the sofas looked like they'd experienced a few...parties (gross). The minibar was locked throughout my stay too - even though I had a credit card registered for extras.The welcome - the guy was perfectly pleasant, but I wasn't shown to my room/helped with my luggage/given any information about the hotel facilities. I'm from the UK so not really familiar with aircon, so when it got really hot having been shown how to work it would have helped!The cleaners - the bed was always made and bathroom cleaned, but it felt like the bare minimum was done. An example of this - one morning I rushed out and left the ironing board up in my room, when I came back the cleaners had obviously been but they'd not put it away.I know these things are relatively minor, but combined add up to a less-than-ideal experience. I wouldn't go back/recommend to a friend.","On behalf of all of us at Hotel Erwin, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback here on TripAdvisor, we apologize that we did not meet your or are own expectation.While we are delighted to hear about the ""things you liked,” we are disappointed to hear of the “things you didn’t like,” and that your Erwin experience fell short of your expectations. We agree that this could add up to a “less-than-ideal experience,” and appreciate your honest feedback. Our staff should have offered to help you to your room and this would have gone a long way to making your stay more comfortable, solving the little problems that you mentioned with the air conditioning and the minibar. I have followed up with the front desk staff. I have also followed up with the housekeeping staff as they should have replace your ironing board in the closet when they serviced your room.Once more, thank you for taking the time to give us feedback on how we can continue to improve the experience and please accept our apology that we did not hit all the little things that turn and average stay into a great stay.Jeff CarpenterGeneral Manager",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: March 2015,"Response from Jeff C, General Manager at Hotel Erwin","Responded Apr 6, 2015"
Hotel Erwin,30,"I definitely give this hotel a 3.5 out of 5 as it was nice, but had a few drawbacks. First the good - Staff was wonderful, super friendly and accommodating to requests. I got the impression that they would go out of their way to make sure that you have the best stay possible. The rooms were very clean and adequately sized, and the beds were SOOOO COMFORTABLE!!! As you can see from the map, the hotel is directly adjacent to the beach and the boardwalk, and is a fairly short drive from LA attractions like Hollywood, Beverly Hills, Chinatown, and the airport.As far as the drawback are concerned, there are a lot of rooms in this hotel but only one small elevator. When we checked in we had to wait for about 10 minutes in the lobby for an elevator to get our luggage up to the room. We did decide to take the stairs the rest of the time we stayed there, but this would definitely be an issue for someone with mobility issues. The room we had did have a very nice “partial ocean view”, but it had a full view of the alley below. There was a large restaurant garbage dumpster directly below our balcony and it offered some less than desirable odors when the door was open. Please also note that Venice Beach is a very “eclectic” neighborhood (well said in some of the other reviews), and at night it isn’t for the faint of heart. I have lived in and around Chicago most of my life and am quite familiar with “eclectic” neighborhoods, but someone who is more conservative may find the area a little intimidating. I certainly would not recommend staying here with small children. Teenagers would definitely enjoy it though!! We did in fact feel safe at the hotel, and took a lot of pleasure in people watching around the neighborhood. All walks of life can definitely be seen here.Overall I thought the hotel was good, but a little over priced for what you received in return. If your whole stay is going to be about the coast and getting at true taste of the Venice Beach and Santa Monica lifestyle, then this is definitely your place. If you’re looking for someplace that’s on the quiet side with some luxury, then you may want to look elsewhere. I’m glad we stayed here, but don’t plan to return.","Thank you for taking the time to write such a candid review and for sharing your Erwin experience with other travelers that are looking for a unique boutique hotel stay. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed our superior guest services, arrangement of the guest room and its amenities, and are glad to have stayed here and got to experience the unique atmosphere that is Venice Beach. We are disappointed that you did not find the hotel to be a good value, but are glad to see you would recommend it. We also hope you change your mind and return, the great thing about Venice Beach is every day is different, it is almost impossible not to have a unique experience every trip as the neighborhood changes and evolves.Thank you again for taking the time to share your experiences.Jeff CarpenterGeneral Manager",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: March 2015,"Response from Jeff C, General Manager at Hotel Erwin","Responded Mar 31, 2015"
Hotel Erwin,30,"HotelDo not let anything fool you this hotel is a block from the beach. Quite a large hotel with a few challenges. Very tiny lobby when trying to check in.It is in a very busy area of Venice Beach and there are a few restaurants in the area but nothing really nice. This hotel and area is for young people. Lots of partying going on. We were woken up several times throughout the night by drunken people in the hallway making lots of noise.Not a safe area as there was security at the entrance and also in the elevators. I quickly took off my rings and diamond tennis bracelet and put them in the hotel safe. I did not want to be a mark.The ElevatorsThis I must mention that for a hotel of this size there is only one elevator so the wait is long to get to the room and even more ridiculous to get to the rooftop bar.The Rooftop BarAbsolutely beautiful with terrific views. Unfortunately when we arrived the turned us away as there was a private function booked from 5:00 pm. They did not tell us at check in. It took us another 15 minutes to get the elevator back to the lobby.This was a big disappointment as we were only staying one night and it was the loveliest place around. Most of Venice Beach is crowed and busy with street vendors, musicians , lots of t-shirt and tattoo shops. Not one nice bar to sit and people watch.To the managers credit when we told him we were kicked out of the Rooftop Bar he quickly gave us 4 free drink vouchers for the lobby bar.The RoomWe booked an Ocean View with a King Bed. We were on the 3rd floor and yes over the parking lot, the garbage bins and a roof top we had a peek of the ocean . If you book and pay for an ocean view make sure you are on the top floor. Our view was terrible.In the morning there were homeless people going through the garbage in the parking lot we overlooked.The room was clean and nicely laid out and the bed very comfortable. Not worth the $420.00 plus $35.00 for valet parking.","Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed and candid review, but most importantly, thank you for being our guest. While we are happy to hear that you enjoyed the arrangement of the guest room with our well-considered array of in-room amenities, as well as, our service to provide you vouchers for an inconvenience that was faced at Hotel Erwin, we are surprised and very disappointed that the rest of your Erwin experience was not as great of a success or of what you had hoped for.Venice is a vibrant neighborhood and can be very busy on weekend nights with a lot of activity as you mention. We do have an eclectic mix of restaurants and bars in our neighborhood, the boardwalk area has more casual dining, finer dining can be found a few blocks away on Abbott Kinney, and I apologize our staff did not provide this information to you.We do staff security at our door to ensure we control entry into the hotel and to ensure only registered guest are allowed access. We take our guest safety and security very seriously. Our officer stationed in the elevator serves double duty as security and keeping the elevator moving as quickly as possible during peak times. We also have a third officer who patrols the property to ensure our guests are not disturbed.High Rooftop lounge can be very busy, and we encourage all of our guest to book reservations in advance so we can ensure we find a time where we can fit them in. I apologize that we could not accommodate you, but I am glad my staff worked towards a resolution.Again thank you for taking the time to share your feedback and please feel free to reach out to me directly if you have any additional feedback our questions.All the best,Jeff CarpenterGeneral ManagerJcarpenter@hotelerwin.com",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: March 2015,"Response from Jeff C, General Manager at Hotel Erwin","Responded Mar 27, 2015"

Hotel Erwin,10,"Even though I hated this place, I want to be fair. The staff was friendly and helpful. I give the staff and food high marks. The property itself is located in a ghetto. Garbage surrounds the property. If you stay here, bring a gun. There is a naked guy who runs through the lobby. It is so overpriced it is offensive.","Charles,Venice Beach is an eclectic, rebellious, and unconventional neighborhood and on your stay its uniqueness manifests as a unclothed man streaking across our parking area. Having watched the video of this event, I understand your concern.Our staff and security team ensured that the individual did not enter the building and watching the video it appears he was taking a short cut through the parking area on his way somewhere. I will not fathom a guess on to where he was going, but he looked in a hurry.We take the security of our guests very seriously. We work with both private security and the local police department to ensure that the unique characters that find their way to our neighborhood stay on the boardwalk and streets that they help make world famous as a bastion of counter-culture.Again I apologize, no one wants to see what you saw, and I can understand your alarm.

Hotel Erwin,30,"We booked this as our last night in L.A. and when we arrived, we pretty much saw immediately, it was not really the place for us. The area of town seemed a bit dicey to us, and the clubs were kitty-corner to the hotel. The valet was nice as we checked in the very tiny drive-in area but you could see in his face that even he saw we were too old for the place haha. The beautiful young lady at check-in was very nice and recommended we upgrade to the ocean view suite. So we figured we’d take the plunge and do it. The bellman took our cart of luggage up as we squished into one of the few (if only) elevator with some young partiers going to the penthouse club. The hallways seemed dingy like they had just painted over the dirty lumpy walls and there was rock music being piped into the hallway thru speakers (!). We got to the “suite” and the furnishings were of a lower quality to us than Ikea (we like Ikea). It was so unwelcoming and there were ugly quirky decals on the glass shower doors and mirror in the bathroom. The Ocean view was over a large, ugly parking lot. The balcony was one of those super skinny types that just barely fit a chair and again, overlooked the parking lot. We asked about the pounding club music coming from overhead and were told our room was below the club – but that it would be closing soon.The minute the bellman left, we looked at each other and decided that we’d rather sleep in our rental car than in this room. It just felt cheap and icky. We called down to the front desk and told them, we were obviously just too old for this hotel and here’s where the story gets really good to me. They were totally cool with that.We came down, checked out and the receptionist even offered to find us another room (since it was 9:00 the night before we left LA). They completely refunded our money too. I’m so glad we tipped the valet and bellman well!Although I can’t recommend the hotel, I must say the people who worked there were really great and wanted to be sure the guests had a great stay. I think you could do better at other hotels quality wise for the type of accommodations they provided but I really have to give them a plus for being so professional in our situation.","We are disappointed that we did not get a chance to host this guest, and that we caused an inconvenience in their travel.We realize that our offbeat and quirky neighborhood might not be the right fit for everyone, but we are happy they were able to find accommodations to their liking.

Hotel Erwin,20,"Vallet is friendly and helpful. Front desk was busy dealing with a guest who was complaining about his bar bill not being given ""Happy Hour Prices."" They were so preoccupied dealing with him, that we were given keys and ignored. What Happy Hour? Is there a Happy Hour? We stayed 2 nights and I can't tell you what this hotel offers other than what reviews and website say.The room was clean, but the door did not click to lock. Not cool. Wonder how many people stayed here thinking they were locked safely inside? Maintenance came and adjusted the door and the locks and fixed the problem. The closet did not open and no way to get to the safe.

Hotel Erwin,10,"I have not stayed at the hotel, however went to the Hightop Roof Bar and could not have felt more unwelcome. First of all, my two girlfriends and I arrived at 2:00 to have a drink and a quick bite. Mid-afternoon. Totally uncrowded. When we asked for a table, the head waiter asked if we were guests of the hotel. We said no. He then carded us (we are all 50 years old). He said although we were not hotel guests, we could have a table for only 1 hour. He also mentioned that they treat their hotel guests ""special"". Clearly we were not. We proceeded to our table. We asked for water and ordered drinks. They brought a carafe of water to our table with three glasses, left it and walked off. We poured it ourselves. We ordered sandwiches (which were very good) and at 2:35, they reminded us that we had to leave by 3:00. At 2:45, we were reminded again we had to leave by 3:00. We spent $100 in 45 minutes there and they were trying to get rid of us the entire time. Enough said. Great view though.","Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

Hotel Erwin,30,"I stayed at the Hotel Erwin in June 2014 in a King Suite with Ocean view. separate bedroom, pull out bed in living room, full kitchen. Let's put this review in context:Hotel room itself- 3 star. Interiors are clean, but spartan. Style is mod-hipster-playful. If you don't expect this, it can be off putting. Reality was fine: beds were comfortable, furnishings were comfortable, bath was very nicely appointed, spacious. Good views of ocean and Venice BoardwalkLocation: THIS IS why you pick this hotel. It provides immediate local access to all of the crazy fun energy of Venice Boardwalk, two block walk up to Abbot Kinney and all the great dining and bars and boutiques there.Amenities-Dining: I dont know why if you came here, you wouldn't go up to Abbot Kinney to eat and drink, but if you do eat in, the Hightop roof bar is one of a kind, and pretty comfortable and enjoyable! And BARLO on first floor is great, small, but great food.All in all, I can't give it 4 stars or more, because we all know ""great 4 star"" hotels are more finely appointed, come with more VIP services and amenities, and at about or less than this price----but it's a solid 3 star hotel, with a 4 star level of hip cool beach chic accessibility to an amazingly energized part of LA.IF this is what you're looking for---you'll enjoy!!","Thank you for spending your birthday weekend with us and for taking the time to write a review about your stay!

Hotel Erwin,20,"We had a 5 night stay in August 2014 which was ok, they hype this hotel gets/gives off is more than the reality. The BARLO staff were excellent and High rooftop bar was good but on the rooftop they had a slight air of snobbery and you were made to feel almost 'grateful' that you could reserve an area to sit and then when you did, you never felt quite comfortable knowing whether your HOUR was up or not and you had staff bringing your bill and telling you that they need the table back half way through, lots of reminders during the stay about how you were 'on a conveyor belt', we went up there twice and it was not the relaxing rooftop experience it should be, or what they seem to think it is, so ordering a bottle of wine up there is only advised by us if it's either raining or if you drink like a fish. I have to say that a lot of the good reviews on here are directed at the roof bar. You don't have to stay there overnight to use the roof bar, you can stay nearby and still use it so it isn't a seling point for someone looking for accommodation in this area. We were staying there and working via laptop as normal during the daytime in the room, so we were in the room a lot, and my oh my, our room was like grand central station, 4 people on the first day tried to get in, a guy with bedding, a woman with towels, a different guy to bring in a mended IPOD dock and yet another guy to put a cuff around the sink plumbing in the bathroom. There's no control about how many people enter that bedroom and have access to your stuff (and we didn't see any safe available to put our passports/money/ipads/laptops phones), this was concerning for us with all of our gadgets etc lying around, so everytime we went out to eat etc, I ended up putting all of our gadgets in my suitcase as this locked. the bathroom was utterly bizarre, the staff/owners have clearly never stayed in one of their own hotels. There was NOWHERE to put stuff, a sink sticking out of the wall in a massive room that had flat walls, no cabinets, no shelves, no counters, nothing. My stuff balanced on the edge of a sink. and I sent pictures to friends and family whilst there and it wasn't for the lack of space as there was loads of space in that room (i will try and attach the pictures to this review). The beds wasn't the most comfy either. This hotel is all about it's own image and unfortunately it believes it's better than it is. However, My biggest problem with this hotel is that by using their wifi, they ensure that you have a problem with hotel Erwin being your home page long after you leave, i'm still battling with it now and anyone who knows about having malware or your home page invaded will tell you, it's infuriating. WHO wants a hotel website as their homepage, WHO? EVER?...certainly not a one off guest! Certainly also a one-off guest who wasn't overly impressed by multiple elements of their stay there. PLEASE RETHINK THIS HOTEL ERWIN!. THIS hotel is totally over branded, hotel Erwin water, frisbees, overpriced 'branded' snacks etc etc..do we recognise hotel erwin 'foodsnacks' and want to pay extra for them?.... errr NO. I think their marketing team should look at little peg, large box and concentrate on offering guests more comfort, better service, less snobbery, less brand, and please stop trying to be people's homepage, NOBODY wants it. A great brand is one that is built on getting its core offering right. When we had to check out in the morning (me and my husband), we did so, and we ate in their integral BARLO (just in their lobby) and we had a walk and when we got back to the hotel we had about an hour to kill so we sat with our 2 cases in their little lobby and quietly played scrabble on our ipad, we couldn't have been quieter or less trouble. I have never been made to feel more like I was in the way, we had about 12 offers of 'can we call you a cab', what are you doing? type stuff... and we'd been staying there 5 days! It's a shame because there's a lot of stuff which could be really good here, it's not a bad hotel, its location is brilliant, the views are stunning from the roof bar (but you don't need to pay their very high nightly rate to use the roof bar!) and it's lacking in some areas and it's frustrating to see that it does put focus into areas, but areas that people don't value as much as 'space to put down toiletries' in a bathroom or a safe to store valuables. There was black mould and 'old' rusting plug holes in the bathroom... I joked to a friend that it was like a prison bathroom, nothing to hurt yourself on. Our room was tired and reminded me of a 1980s. bed and breakfast bedroom, tired carpet, bathroom and a clothes rail and ironing board just against the main wall in the open near to the tv. a bit mad and all the colours, spots, stripes, blue walls etc just blew your brain. BARLO was amazing. The staff were great, the atmosphere in there was great, the free puddings they brought for everyone out at closing time was lovely and we ate there and drank there multiple times and found it relaxed and friendly. We were told that Larry's would allow us to drink and eat and book it to our room but at the end of our Larry's evening we found that this was too much of a problem with non-interlinking systems and us not having our PASSPORT with us so after some fuss with staff over it so we paid in the end with cash.","Thank you for taking the time to write such a detailed and candid review.

After complaining that this was not what I paid for I was given a new room which did have a small ocean view if you went outside and looked right.I did see they do have rooms which directly overlook the ocean, but apparently these are ocean suites. To call my room a 'premium ocean view' was a stretch of the imagination. It would better be described and an ocean view or partial ocean view.To make things worse, I was charged for mini bar items I never used on checkout. It took a bit of arguing to fix the problem.","Thank you for sharing your experience with us and for being our guest.

Hotel Erwin,10,"Considering the price of the room $362 I wasnt very happy with my one night stay here. I was placed in room 301 which although looked lovely and had a very comfortable bed, it backed onto the steel stairwell and the elevator shaft. Frequently lengthy wait times for the elevator lead to heavy traffic on the stairs, this resulted in the stairs smashing against the room wall and rattling the bedhead for hours on end. After making a call to reception nothing was done about my complaint as the hotel was fully booked. It was sorry but tough luck. I understand that I couldn't be moved it was just unfortunate that there wasn't any kind of compensation at all considering the cost of the room. So apart from being aesthetically pleasing and having a wonderful location, I would confirm the location of your room before checking in and ensure you are not near the stairwell at all.","Thank you for your review.

Hotel Erwin,10,"First of all, I have stayed at Erwin in the past and absolutely loved it. My boyfriend and I both manage Hotel properties around the world. We have been loyal guests staying on the same side of the hotel every year for our aniversary. My boyfriend surprised me recently with a visit to my favorite area/Hotel and we left absolutely disappointed. We will NEVER be coming back to Erwin.The day I checked in I was greeted by a lovely valet staff. Upon entering the hotel I was greeted by Miguel. At first seeming friendly and helpful, giving us a ""nicer"" room for more money, my boyfriend and I than overheard him saying in spanish to another worker that he was making money off of us. On top of that, I found the comments made to me upon my check-in inappropriate and very unprofessional, so much so that I made sure to take down this gentleman's name to write this review. This being said, the entire front desk staff, throughout our whole stay, were extremely unhelpful and unorganized. The phone was never answered, we did not feel welcomed or friendly, and I felt as though the whole time we were trying to be sold things. When we arrived at the room, we found that an upgrade literally meant a few steps closer towards the ocean. If you guys are coming here for an ocean view, do not be fooled, all the rooms are a partial ocean view. We finally got a hold of the head of the front desk, and being in hospitality myself I wasn't fond of the way he handled things. He had no customer service and made me feel like a stranger in the hotel. There was a genuine disconnect when speaking with him, and began to mock us about how he was still going to charge us. After arguing back and forth he finally agreed to not charge us the fee for the better room and hung up. The only person who made our stay tolerable and went above and beyond for us at the front desk was Eugene. It seems like they've made a lot of changes to this Hotel, including the staff, and we are highly disappointed with it.The next day, wanting to go out for breakfast, we came downstairs and gave our keys to the valet. My boyfriend did not have his wallet on him so we figured we would give a big tip when we came back. When we got in the car and didn't tip, the bald valet with tattoos up and down his arms became extremely rude and went out of his way to let us know he was upset that we had not tipped. We were appalled at the staffs behavior so far while staying here at Erwin. I would not recommend it unless you want to stay in a cheap (not in price) Hotel run by people who don't really know what they're doing and don't care about the guests.","Thank you for bringing your experience to our attention.

Hotel Erwin,30,"On Expedia, this hotel is advertised as Santa Monica, and we were a little disappointed when we drove 5 minutes South to Venice. But that was where the disappointment ended. The hotel is in a fantastic location 50 metres from the famous boardwalk, and all the action. Rooms on the north side have better balconies and views.The hotel bar is well stocked and the bartender was great - we were given a $25 voucher to spend because our room wasn't ready.The only sour note occurred after we had left. My wife left 3 pair of new shoes at reception and when we rang from Santa Barbara, Matt, the guy at reception didn't seem particularly helpful. We had to ring twice and still he wouldn't put us through to housekeeping.Luckily our daughter in-law was in the area and went there. She actually had to tell him she wouldn't leave until he got housekeeping. They had the shoes.","We’re happy to hear you were pleasantly surprised with our location! We’re right in the heart of Venice and our proximity to the beach just can’t be beat.

All I hear is cars passing by. We called to change a room and the person said he will check. Never heard back. We didn't sleep all night due to the noise. Do not recommend this hotel.

The Garland,30,"A lot about this place feels good, but it has its negative elements. Rooms on the”First Floor” of one pavilion are actually below grade—a truly bad surprise to see the berm outside. We heard hall noises from outside our room and had smokers congregate nearby, making noise and smoke. The rooms are comfortable although not special. The bedding doesn’t match that available in many two star hotels. Rooms are not value priced and even self parking can only be had with a serious fee. My personal conclusion is that this venue is overrated","Dear roberti,Thank you for your feedback. We are disappointed to hear we did not meet your expectations.

The Garland,30,"We arrived at 10:00 am, which was very early for check in. I explained at the desk that I apologized for being so early, but could we possibly leave our bags as we wanted to head to Universal that day? They said we could, and we prepared to take their 11:00 am trolley to Universal. We waited in the lobby until 10:45, then went out to meet the trolley. At 11:10, there was still no driver in sight. They said there was something about the driver taking a break and wasn't back yet. Ok, fine. We finally boarded the trolley fifteen minutes behind their schedule, at 11:15. We had a lovely day at Universal, and according to the schedule, the trolley would arrive at 7:15. We came around the corner at 7:11 and it was already driving away. I called the hotel and asked if they could tell the driver to circle the parking lot to come back to us and were told they couldn't do that. So we had to wait yet another hour. I had requested to be on the highest floor possible but was only one floor up from the ground. Checking in hours beforehand didn't help me at all.The hotel bed was possibly the worst ever I've had. You don't really get INTO this bed, you get ONTO it. If you moved at all you felt like you were going to fall onto the floor. It was loud and springy. If my husband even moved his arm there was a loud squeak. Plus there were stains on the sheets. Chocolate? Blood? God knows. I slept on top of the covers because I'm not crazy about sleeping on a stranger's used sheets.So the good: beautiful grounds, elevators were fast, all the men working out front run their butts off. You can ask them any question about the area and they are happy to help.The bad: forget the trolley because no matter how early or late you are, you will still miss it. Also the terrible bed.","Dear licoddi,Thank you for your feedback. We are disappointed to hear we did not meet your expectations.

The Garland,10,"I have to say up front that the staff were very accommodating with our issue, and it was handled in a timely and acceptable manner with a room change the next day.I think the truly classy move would have been for them to not charge us for the sleepless night. After all, we mentioned up front that we could not get much sleep.But here’s the issue: We were booked into a king premiere room that had an adjoining door. We didn’t think it was a problem—who hasn’t stayed in a hotel room with an adjoining door before? Plus, with the cinderblock walls, we didn’t think sound would be an issue. But when we woke up to the sounds of our neighbor watching TV at 1:00 a.m., we worried it was going to be a sleepless night for us. That continued for 30 minutes or so, at which point we thought we could return to sleep. Then our neighbor played piano music—presumably to try to fall asleep—for another 30 minutes. When that didn’t work for our neighbor, she started pleasuring herself. We could hear every detail—it was truly disturbing. If we were a family with children, we would have had a lot of explaining to do.At first we couldn’t figure out where the noise was coming from. But as I walked around it became clear: the “adjoining door.” Somehow the room acts like a funnel, pushing all the noise right there!In the morning, we explained the problem to the front desk and they were quick to offer a solution, which we were grateful for: a non-adjoining queen room two floors down. The woman helping us did say that they have had similar noise complaints in the past about their adjoining rooms. We went to Universal that day, and came back to our new room. The staff moved our bags for us, which was very nice. Again, the staff member who helped us (a different person) also mentioned past noise complaints. That’s when we got a little peeved.If you KNOW there’s a noise problem, why don’t you fix it? Cement the damn door off. At least put in weather stripping to try and minimize sound traveling in. Or, at the very least, DON’T BOOK PEOPLE WHO ARE OVER 50 YEARS OF AGE INTO A ROOM YOU KNOW TO HAVE SOUND ISSUES. Duh.And I know what you’re thinking: why didn’t you report the issue when it first started at 1:00 a.m.? Well, we were just woken up in the middle of the night and weren’t thinking clearly. We hoped the sounds would cease, not escalate.Thanks for reading.","Dear 589russellh,We are disappointed to hear that we did not meet your expectations during your stay with us.

Garland holds customers responsible for their bad business practices.I had previously stayed at the Garland over ten times for the past five years, but when I showed up with my kids in tow to check-in to my room last Friday night, they told me I would have to PAY TWICE? The desk agent then the manager Alfred gave me an apologetic fifteen minute story about how they were having trouble collecting payment from the vendor with whom they contracted to reserve my hotel room. Thus, I would have to pay for the room again. I argued that they should have notified me before I was standing in front of them, that it was not my fault to resolve their vendor problems, to NO EFFECT. They offered no relief from double payment and told me to take it up with the internet company. Further, though they said they were terminating that vendor’s contract, I still noted that the TOP HIT on Google for Garland reservations was the company through which I reserved. In the end I spent twenty more minutes on the phone with the third part and was able to get my money back from them. My disgust is with the management and company culture which holds their customers entirely responsible for their business problems.

The Garland,20,"Let me start by saying we went in October and had saved up for this family trip! This hotel is beautiful! The grounds are immaculate and have an Old Hollywood feel that is great! We loved the pool area with tree lights and huge lounge beds and bar you could walk up to. Honestly, have nothing bad to say about the look and feel. We ate breakfast one morning at the restaurant on site and that was scrumptious.Here is the bad. We paid a decent amount of money for this hotel and choose it for it's amenities like coffee maker in room, refrigerator and free shuttle to Universal and the Metro. This is where everything fell apart. Our first morning we had coffee pods and glasses. Great start! And traveling with a kid, we brought lots of snacks etc, so the the fridge. glasses, etc. are a time saver. We got back from Universal around 9pm at night and our room had not been cleaned. No new coffee pods, glasses dirty and towels on the floor. And normally we could use towels again, but the water had sprayed out of the shower and we used them to clean up the floor. Husband called front desk to say room hadn't been cleaned, could we at least get clean towels and glasses. At this point I went downstairs with the kid to enjoy the last hour of the hot tub being open. We came back around 10pm, and still no towels or glasses. Called again. Waited 10 mintues, still nothing. At this point it is late and we would like to shower and get in bed. My husband went down to the front desk and waited until somebody gave him towels and clean glasses. Next morning, requested new coffee pods. Waited, nothing. Ended up walking two blocks to Starbucks to get coffee.We then catch the afternoon shuttle to the Metro stop. The shuttle goes past the Metro to Universal. When we don't get off, the guy says, ""Why are you still on?"" To which we reply we are going to the Metro. He asks, ""Why didn't you tell me that?"" Didn't know we had to. The previous day when we rode it to Universal it stopped automatically at the Metro both there and back. Anyway, wait for the Universal folks to get off and a few get on. Assuming we are going to the Metro. He pulls into the Metro and never slows down or stops. We are at the road to go back out and I yell, ""Hey, we need off!"" The driver stops almost in the middle of the road to let us off. I am thinking in my head, but don't say, ""We just told you where we were going."" Anyway coming back from the Walk of Fame, we discuss how we don't want to take the Metro back, as we can't be sure the shuttle will be there to get us. So we pay money for an Uber.Get into our room, and yet again, no cleaning has taken place. Really?? Still no coffee pods, dirty glasses sitting around, old towels (although we did hang these ones up). Call down to the front desk again. This time, about 30 minutes later someone does bring up towels and glasses. But we also walked down to the pool and swiped towels down there.We spent three nights there, and again, loved the grounds, but the cleaning of rooms, restocking amenities and shuttle were horrible. Upon check out, I asked the lady checking us out if I could speak with a Manager. She asked if I could hold on a minute. Not sure if that meant it was her or going to get someone. There was a line behind me, so not sure if she was wanting to help them first. At this point, our Uber had arrived to take us to the airport, and I couldn't risk missing our flight. Not sure if management would have addressed our issue and offered compensation or not.Pros: lovely grounds, pool area great, drinks yummy, breakfast delicious, porters great (don't think I ever touched a door), rooms quiet.Cons: no housekeeping, no response from staff when asking for items, shuttle inconsistent, price paid for what we received.","Dear ElizzieB,Thank you for your feedback as we truly value any feedback given from our guests.

The Garland,30,"This hotel will transport you back in time to an era of classic Hollywood. Some areas seem older but the vibe of the hotel is chic and relaxed. I had a room overlooking the garden restaurant and it was pleasant. The rooms are quiet but some people are not respectful while they walk in the hallways and the sound will echo and wake you. This is not within the hotel control. What is within their control is housekeeping. The bed and bedroom along with the entry was clean. However, the towels in the bathroom had no less than three different colored long hairs on them. It almost felt like all the display towels had a hair added. I understand that towels attract hair, but two of the three different hairs found were dark in appearance and so stood out quite starkly to the whiteness of the towel if anybody had bothered to glance at it.

I have stayed at the hotel multiple times in the last several months, but I was informed that the hotel policy is that if your name is not on the reservation you cannot be checked-in. The first manager (Kylie) I spoke with reiterated the hotel policy, and she went on to say, ""even your last names are not the same."" I had a digital copy of my marriage certificate and a copy of my spouse's ID, yet that was not sufficient because ""you could've gotten divorced since then."" The comments were irrelevant and aggravating.A Hilton hotel has accepted a marriage certificate but an independently run hotel has more red tape?? Ultimately, I called Hotels.com to update the reservation names.

This kept us awake most of the night. To be fair, the next morning I complained to reception, who said they would change our room. They changed our room while we spent the day at universal, unfortunately we used the hotel shuttle service, they dropped us off in a orange bus and advised us the bus picks up at quarter past the hour from the same spot. After sitting at the pick up spot the best part of 90 minutes, another couple phoned the hotel to find out were our shuttle was. They was advised the bus had definitely been and gone and would be back in a hour. Sat in the parking lot when another couple of unmarked buses turned up. I walked over to find out if they was our bus to be told they changed the bus and it was in fact our bus.

Drinks, food and parking a bit expensive but it is LA so not unexpected. Free trolley bus to the station and Universal was excellent and regular.The worst thing re the bar food by the pool.

The Garland,30,"I left The Garland distinctly unimpressed with the entire experience. I found Front Desk staff to be aloof and patronising. The hotel makes no effort to remind guests that they should behave quietly in corridors at night, so families and groups tended to kick up one heck of a noise. Two female cleaners, early morning, were actually in the corridors shouting and yelling at each other - not arguing, but literally screeching. Do they assume all guests check out at 8am and the place is empty?Again, I found the restaurant maitre d' to be patronising, as if she was doing us a huge favour by finding a table for us. The hotel met our needs but under no circumstances could I state that there was an element of luxury about it. On two occasions, our toilet blocked and flooded up to the rim, forcing us to use public restrooms. On two separate days. We explained that nothing solid had been put down there and that there was something wrong with the plumbing system. To be fair, the hotel manager, Ben, made an appropriate gesture for this, but it was mighty inconvenient. I wouldn't stay here again.",Mr Hall:Thank you for your feedback and for contacting me privately.

The Garland,10,I stayed here and was advised of no smoking policy .... did not smoke in the room. Or patio .... but when they checked the room They found a pack of cigarettes in the trash which only implemented that I am a smoker not that I smoked in the room which I told them intern that they needed to prove to me that there was a scent of smoke in the air and they could not but they still manage to take my deposit of $200 that day. I’ve had a lawyer contact them to obtain that money again and they can’t show any proof all they had was a picture of a cigarette pack in the trash!,"Dear Tammy C,We appreciate you staying with us during your quick trip up to LA. Our team takes an active approach to protect and ensure that we have a smoke free environment for all guests at the property. We maintain a high stand of integrity and neutral biased on charging additional fees such as the deep cleaning. We would never want anyone to feel taken advantage, and regret that you feel such way. Our management team completed an investigation, and the evidence shows that we had grounds to charge the deep cleaning fee.

The Garland,30,"The hotel itself is pleasant and the staff is friendly and helpful, but they really need to improve the food and presentation you get with room service. My breakfast was a plop of yogurt with some berries and served in a cardboard box. Surely they can do better than this? We also ate dinner on the patio one night since the restaurant was so packed and that food was not appealing either. The tortilla chips were old, and my husband’s burger came with no lettuce or tomato and no condiments, and my kale salad was very plain. It really wouldn’t take that much to make the food more appealing.","Thank you for choosing The Garland for your recent visit to LA. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience.

The Garland,20,First impression was not good and did not improve. It cost £60 from LAX to the hotel and the traffic is awful. We were given a room which looked onto the car park and a very busy road which had continuous noise all day and night. The balcony door did not close properly making it worse. Food was good more so the breakfast but expensive. Booked a shared ride through the hotel to go back to LAX and given a pick up time early morning. Half an hour before due we were contacted to say the ride was there. They had changed the pick up time but did not inform us. Luckily the driver waited 10 mins for us. One good point is the free shuttle to Universal but there is nothing else around the hotel to walk to. Would not go back.,"Dear Stuart y,Thank you for choosing The Garland for your recent visit to LA. We appreciate you taking the time to share your experience.

The photos o of the pool are a bit flattering - it's actually quire small and was crowded when we were there. Rooms a good size but the A/C unit was situated next to my bed which made for a noisy night.We ate in the courtyard when there as we couldn't get in to the restaurant. Unfortunately everything went in to meltdown that evening - I think in part to some of the food being cooked on the grill in the courtyard, and some coming from the kitchen which was obviously too busy to cope. This meant that my wife didn't get her main course, and other tables were having similar problems. The waitress was very apologetic when I explained why I wouldn't be giving a tip, but things were so bad I was surprised that the restaurant manager did not appear to discuss with all the tables affected.The gym is excellent.","Thank you for choosing The Garland for your recent visit to LA.

The Garland,10,"The hotel offers actually very little to like about!On the other side, most of the hotel staff is only very poorly and unprofessionally trained, some of them even aloof and rude, probably that's also why they keep you waiting for every kind of service provided!Furthermore, the hotel is located literally next to the very busy 101 freeway and the L.A. River, therefore the hotel rooms with their bad pseudo 60s design are very noisy and damp.

This hotel is quirky and looks good But our room was very noisy with the balcony door open from the busy freeway next to it The front yard restaurant food in the evening was good but the breakfast buffet a bit hit and miss - one morning they actually ran out of food and we had to wait a good 10minutes for it to be re stocked but with no apology The only thing I can say is the staff need people skills training.

The Garland,30,Just after staying in The Garland (22nd to 25th). Firstly the positives:-location is not the worst. A max $15 uber will get you to anywhere worth visiting (apart from beaches) and when there you can easily walk to other places.- free shuttle to Universal/Metro if you wanna save money and not get uber!- great restaurant and food- English waitress; dont know her name but exceptional service and so nice and helpful with menu selections- pool area / inside area very nice and the hotel has a real classy feel to it.-girl who checked us in (Jackie I think) was lovelyI do have issues that bring it down though. Aside from the great English waitress and one nice barman; the service was simply shocking. For that reason I have a major issue with the 15% gratuity. I'll tip 20%+ always if the service warrants it but the majority of service in the hotel was shocking! I detected a major attitude with 2 staff and it is unfortunate as it is the reason I'm docking stars in the review! I wont identify them as maybe it was a bad few days for them when we were there but it was simply shocking and the automatic 15% tip (as some reviews state) may lead to complacency! My question is why the automatic 15% as who does not tip that at least in this day and age??This is my 3rd trip to LA and I decided to stay north this time instead of Santa Monica! I'd defo recommend staying near Hollywood and this hotel is lovely asthetically and worth staying in to make up your own opinion. I'm back in LA next April and I personally wont stay here again as the service from certain people left such a bad taste in my opinion that I will head elsewhere.,"Dear Enfmea85,We strive for the highest service standards in the industry and deeply regret the inconsistencies that you experienced during your stay. A 15% service charge is included in all of our outlets as a convenience to our guests so as not to feel obligated to tip the customary 18% to 20%, knowing that our team is taken care of by one of the highest living wages in the nation. The service charge is shared by all of the front of house service team and paid out in its entirety. Of course, we encourage our guests to tip additional when receiving outstanding service such as you experienced from Verolga and a bartender during your visit.

The Garland,30,"Hotel is nice enough, but we have had a number of issues. First of all as soon as you arrive, they charge you $100 per day to cover any accidents which may occur. Then they charge you $25 per day to park your car in their car park. If this was not enough, their card machine then denied both mine and my wife’s credit cards. So they then made me call my bank to sort out the issue, this was all happening at about 1.00 AM after two very long flights. Eventually it got sorted out.The other MAJOR is is the magnetic door cards. On three separate occasion they failed to work, and we had to keep going back to reception to have them reset. The staff said it was my fault as the card was either too close to my credit cards, or the static in my pants made it demagnetise. This is a pathetic excuse, as it has never happened at any other hotels I’ve stayed at.Also the hotel is located very close to a freeway, so I would recommend that you purchase some earplugs or you won’t be able to sleep as the cars do not stop all night.If your looking to stay in a nice quiet quality hotel, then this is NOT the place to stay.","Dear 88coline,Thank you for taking the time to reminisce about your stay at The Garland.

The room was clean and tidy but quite small, especially the bathroom space. The annoying thing with the hotel, is that you can hear people closing doors and being in the corridors early in the morning.We took advantage of the shuttle between the hotel and the metro station/Universal Studios, which is all complimentary. It is about a 10-15 minute walk to the metro station, which we did several times. There is also a shopping complex up the road where you can purchase snacks etc.Would I stay here if I came back, probably not, as I think that I would like to be a bit more centrally located.",Mrs Perth:Congratulations on your Honeymoon!

The Garland,20,We decided to stay at this hotel as our main purpose of our visit was to spend time at universal studios. I noticed on the website that they had a shuttle that would take you to universal studios I knew this would be really helpful for me and my son. I’ve booked the hotel on this basis. The first night we had a room which was based across the highway the noise was terrible and I hardly got any sleep the next morning I complained about this and they helpfully moved us to a room with less noise the next day. There was gym facilities and a restaurant on site. Overall as we were sightseeing and we also factored in a trip to Vegas meant that we did not have much dealings with the hotel staff.The only thing I would mention was on the day of arrival the receptionist told me that they would keep a $400 retainer on my credit card I did at that point thought that was quite high. On our day of departure a couple checked in and they were told that they would be charged $100 retainer on their card. Was slightly offended that I was charged more and at that point as we were leaving I didn’t care. Obviously they must’ve thought I was some kind of trampy hotel guest. On this basis I would say they have a unfair policy and wouldn’t return.,"Dear affy1979,Thank you for choosing to stay with us and for providing us your feedback. We are saddened to hear about the miscommunication or misunderstanding.

We had a 2 queen room and the room faced the freeway. The sliding door could be opened but the noise deafening. To keep the room from being stuffy, we had to run the AC but the unit is right next to the bed and blows freezing air on the people in it. I tried to build a wall of pillows to block the breeze. If 2 people had been in the bed, the other would have been miserable. Also the alarm clock went off at 6:30 am even though I'd checked that it was off. Couldn't figure out how to shut off the alarm so turned the volume down. My brother rented a king room and his closet had a nasty smell in the carpet.

The rooms are noisy. We could hear the guests above. Every time they moved, it made the headboard bang against the wall. The AC was so loud, we had to shut it off. There was also an annoying humming sound that kept us up all night. We were notified that there would be no hot water when we checked in. We agreed that this would be ok as we did not need to shower. However, when we went to get ready for the event we were going to, we realized there was no water at all! There is a big difference between no hot water and no water!

The Garland,30,"Stayed here with my husband and kids during our vacation to Universal Studios & Disneyland. The experience was...schizophrenic. There was a lot of “wow, the Christmas lights and fireplace are so cool in the lobby!” to “is this where we’re sleeping?! Is this stil the same hotel, it looks like a weird outdated dorm complex that’s not connected to the lobby”. Or, “the courtyard is so cool and look at that lady reading in the cabana or those guys playing fooseball!” to “the room looks a little like a prison cell. Are those cinder block walls?!”So here’s a quick breakdown of The Garland and our experience:Pros:- great central location to Universal Studios. Complimentary trolley/shuttle to and from Universal Citywalk on the hour, every hour that we used on the first night. For the days we didn’t want to wait, we called a Lyft and it was less than a $10 one way ride for 4 people total.- exterior at night is beautiful and has an old Hollywood magical feel. Lobby is warm, inviting and eclectic and the inner courtyard is such a nice common area for guest to hang out (fooseball table, sitting areas, lights).- super friendly and helpful staffCons:- our room felt outdated and was the description of mid century modern. Super modern bathroom but not very user friendly in design (below). Main sleeping area felt like my grandparents 1970s house- funky orange print and cinder block walls.- “hotel” is older but felt like it was more like an apartment complex with a nice boutique hotel lobby. Could tell they renovated certain areas to bring up to date but left other areas as-is.- again, I know this was a retro hotel but the elevator is probably original to the place. Really slow and always full when it stopped on our floor 😑- shower pressure was 9/10 BUT the temperature was lukewarm at the hottest setting. After long days walking, I was hoping for a hot shower and was disappointed both nights we were there with the tepid water.- bathroom is modern and updated but had a weird half shower without a door and a little “porthole”...? With the tepid water temperature, the heat didn’t stay enclosed and I was cold as I was showering. Very weird.- Noise: not inside the hotel but outside. Our room was literally next to the freeway separated by a parking lot that had car alarms going off all night. I woke up the first night at 4am from car alarms going off non-stop.Overall was a good experience but not the most comfortable hotel. We literally only slept there because we were out all day so was disappointed that the time we were inside wasn’t as relaxing.","Dear momof3dragons,Thank you for choosing to stay with us.

The Garland,30,"Great little boutique hotel...on paper. Great location to Universal, kid and pet friendly, relaxed vibe overall. Friendly staff and clean, well manicured property. HOWEVER don't plan to actually sleep at this hotel as noise levels from the street will keep you up all hours but assuming you can ignore this, as many can in big cities, good luck in ignoring every single word ( and activity) of the folks on either side of you at least til the wee hours of the morning! I have two young kids, impossible to get them to sleep and enjoy a quiet glass of wine as the walls are literally like paper. As such kids kept up, mom kept up, no relaxing beverage at end of long day...no relaxed, happy parents after a night spent with two unhappy tired kids. Would never come back here for this reason...if I cannot relax in relatvie peace at the end of a long day then seriously what is the point?? Huge shame, huge disappointment. Really only have two requirements for a ""good"" hotel...clean rooms/grounds and quiet at least from the point of view of room to room quiet. Huge fail at the Garland on this.","Dear TMarie08,We are saddened and disappointed we did make you feel comfortable during your stay.

The Garland,30,"Good aesthetic to the hotel and very instagramable decor. The minus points are definitely some of the customer service. On face value it's all very polite but if an issue needs to be raised you'll get a very contrasting response. Room service food arrived late and stone cold to which the staff weren't bothered about at all neither did they even apologise or try to rectify the situation. Food ordered by the pool was covered in rock salt and almost inedible. Drinks are advertised via social media in glasses by the pool which isn't the case, a shame as it makes it feel less special. Last word of warning try and get a room that isn't facing the freeway as it is so loud! Especially at night. Overall food is quite expensive and you're better off walking to Ralph's supermarket for light bites or looking at restaurants elsewhere. All things considered it is a nice hotel with a nice pool and really useful shuttles to Universal and City walk.","Dear Livmccullough,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

The Garland,30,"Hotel looks lovely on instagram however it can be a bit misleading on some pics. On arrival the hotel, main areas, and pool are really nice. Our room was at the back and was noisy due to the main roads by the car park which is what you overlook. I would avoid these rooms if you are a light sleeper.First night ordered room service and was totally cold upon arrival. Not what you expect for the price. Food at hotel is expensive so I would recommend going out the hotel and left for a 5 min walk to Ralph’s supermarket which serves hot meals to take away which are cheap and has a Starbucks and Chinese there. Also get the trolley to citywalk lots to choose from.One morning we needed to get breakfast at hotel and called for room Service as we didn’t have long. Called to see if it was busy and she said no. Explained that we ordered room service other day and it was cold. She replied to say ‘oh well they must have been busy that day’. Again not great response. We decided to go eat at the restaurant and the Buffet breakfast was good cost $19.The pictures show you having cocktails in a glass at the pool on Instagram but that isn’t what you get in reality. Plastic cups for $12 a drink. Pool food average but the pool area is nice to relax in.Customer service friendly until you actually want them to do something and then it seems to go a bit downhill.Take advantage of the free trolley service to universal and city walk. This is a great plus of the hotel.Overall hotel is lovely on arrival and great for universal.","Dear Perky28,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.

The cinema is NOT for guests to enjoy watching movies free of charge.The room we stayed in is near the highway, although there's balcony but you can't sit out there at all, it's so noisy with traffic all day, even at night and early morning, even with the door shut you can still hear the noisy traffic.The only good thing about this hotel is they have free bus to Universal Studio.","Dear DaisyUK2016,Thank you for choosing to stay with us.

The Garland,30,"We stayed here for 2 nights as part of our honeymoon trip organised by Trailfinders. The location is great for visiting Universal Studios, Griffith Observatory, or getting the Metro to Hollywood Boulevard and beyond. The hotel provides a complimentary return shuttle bus service on a lovely retro style bus from early morning to late afternoon. This is a fantastic service for guests, and if you plan to visit Universal Studios, then I would recommend this hotel for location alone.The hotel has a lovely retro vibe, and the decor in the rooms was bright and relaxing. The room and bathroom facilities were nice and clean. There is no iron in the room, maybe you can request one if needed.The hotel is located right beside the freeway, and we were on the 6th floor looking over the courtyard/pool area and directly beyond this is the freeway. It was quite noisy early in the morning, and difficult to return to sleep. The A/C was also quite noisy.There was also no complimentary bottled water, which was a pity. However, there is a mini-fridge though, and Ralph's grocery store is only a few blocks away if you want to buy water and snacks.We only had drinks at the bar, so cannot vouch for the breakfast buffet or restaurant.The pool area is lovely and relaxing, and in the evening there was a lovely atmosphere. There were quite a few families with children, so the hotel definitely caters for family trips.We had a lovely check-in experience with one of the ladies at reception, and she was very helpful letting us know what we could visit nearby and what transport arrangements to make.Altogether, location and service meant that we enjoyed our stay at The Garland. If we return to LA again and wish to stay in the North Hollywood area, I would definitely return to the hotel.","Dear Cabaistehead,Firstly, congratulations!

The Garland,30,"I stayed at the Garland for a weekend in LA with my nine year old daughter. The hotel is adorable and a cool 70’s California vibe. Great decor touches and just what I was looking for. The hotel is right off on 101 and easy to hop on and off to get places. The pool was nice and the food was really good! Had the short rib tacos for room service one evening and they were so great! So, why the average rating? Well, there were a few issues. First, when we checked in (early, which was great), we got to the room and when we opened the door someone was painting inside. Didn’t love being in a room with paint smell initially. The TV was not working so we called someone and they were unable to fix it right away. I asked them to come back later since I felt uncomfortable standing there while the person was on hold with the cable provider. Finally, on our last night I heard a small knock at the door and before I could get up and go answer the door opened and someone walked in. There really needs to be some procedural changes made on all of the above to make a female guest feel more comfortable.Aside from the negatives, we loved the little hotel and its charm. I did have really high expectations for the price and I would say it met our expectations overall with some strong positives and the things The Garland should improve.","Dear 484kristinap,Thank you for choosing to stay with us.

The air conditioner in our room could not be utilized during our stay because the smell of marijuana was in the ventilation system.We were somewhat surprised when in essence all that was suggested was to spray the hallway and room with air freshener to combat the odor. We also found it peculiar that my husband was able to run a bar tab by providing our room number. I was told I needed to provide a credit card instead of our room number at the exact same bar.Staying at The Garland Hotel was an overall disappointment.","Dear brooke3times,Thank you for taking the time to provide your feedback.

The Garland,30,"This hotel is really nice in terms of ambiance, location, and service but just okay in many other aspects. For $270 a night, the hotel quality of room is pretty average. The bed feels somewhat cheap (not very firm or particularly comfortable) and the room is pretty small. The bathroom shower overflows and gets water all over the ground outside it due to there being no door or curtain to close as an option. The restaurant charges a service fee of 12% on everything and you have to tip on top of that, so for example we ate there for convenience a few nights before going out for the night/day, and a two beers plus two chicken Caesar wraps were $70 after tip. Two burgers and two drinks was $60 after tip another night. The pool is nice and the overall aesthetic is very cool, but it just seems like they should offer more affordable options for quick bites and drinks instead of making things priced so high. This was pretty overpowering on my outlook. The parking lot was full with no spots available one day due to an event that was going on, and I had purchased a 5 night pass for $25 a day. I had to park along the curb for the day, which isn’t great since I already paid for parking. For these reasons, I give The Garland a 3 star review. If the prices were changed to include more affordable quick bites and meals, the shower and room/bed situation was changed, and other slight improvements it would easily be a 4 star for me. Overall good stay, just nothing crazy.","Dear Ryan D,Thank you for choosing to stay with us. When you have a moment, we would like to connect with you directly before you depart the hotel.

The Garland,30,"The location was fantastic, the food at the Front Yard was good, the Rose Spritzer was tasty & refreshing and the fastest elevators ever. However, I was disappointed with the overall stay, for several reasons.CLEANLINESS: When I checked in, there was a bug in my first room. I was moved, however, it did very little improve my comfort level in any room at the hotel. Bugs in the hotel are probably not the norm, however, there was no follow up from management regarding my experience. Suggestion: If someone has a bad experience there should be some sort of follow up with that customer. It doesn't happen all the time, but it should. That start gave me little confidence in the hotel as a whole.SLEEP QUALITY: The beds are very comfortable, however, the walls are paper thin. I could hear almost everything in the rooms next to me and from the hallway. The air conditioner was also very loud in our room, so getting to sleep was tough.SERVICE: I went to the bar 3 times. Each time with at least two people behind the bar and 2-3 people at the bar, I waited what seemed an unnecessary amount of time without being acknowledged. I have been in hospitality positions before, and even if I was helping other customers, it takes nothing to say I will be right with you in passing.

There’s a schedule right on site, takes you right to universal.Room: funky and fresh decor, very clean.

In my particular room, it was so old and definitely needed to be replaced. I could hardly sleep from the constant noise humming from this thing. As they were hosting a huge conference onsite, there was no way to change my room. That was a bummer, especially because I was there to celebrate my birthday.Overall: I would stay again for the convenience of being so close to universal only if I called in advance to learn whether or not they are hosting a conference during the time of my stay.

The Garland offers a great shuttle service to Universal, and if you are only going to Universal, you really would not need to rent a car. We really enjoyed our breakfast at the Front Yard, great menu and delicious food. The Garland is a comfortable, clean hotel, with an outdoor swimming pool. We, unfortunately, did not get to enjoy the pool with the unseasonably cold weather in March. The Garland has s self-serve laundry room and was very convenient to do a load of laundry while traveling. Our only complaint about the hotel was the lack of consistent internet service. Unfortunately, when calling down to the Front Desk, the only solution was to come down to the lobby for a stronger signal and this was just not what we paid for.

The Garland,20,"Upon arrival at this hotel we received a lovely welcome from the valet, over the time we were there we find that he was the only friendly face that we would encounter on our stay. Positives for this hotel are its proximity to universal studios and the pool and its movies each night (Finding Dory, Caspar and the Lego Movie while we were there), the gym is a great facility if you have to to use it.Unfortunately there were way more negatives for us, and we would not consider this hotel on future trips to LA. Prior to our arrival we had driven across from San Diego and our most sensible decision perhaps was not to go on the jet boat ride and get completely soaked just as we left. On arrival in our room at the Garland we changed, placed our wet clothes on the balcony in the warmth and headed out to explore the hotel and get food.We had a lovely tea at universal city walk and went back to the room to grab our swimming things and head to the pool, only to find a snotty note about how our wet clothes drying on the balcony were spoiling the visual look of the hotel. We had been there for 3 hours! This was also a slight annoyance to us due to the fact that our room was below lobby level (try to avoid getting a room in the 100’s) so not on view to the road or any other residents (we overlooked the rear car park). I do not take kindly to the cleaner entering my room and placing damp smelly clothes back in the room each time I tried to get them dry. Also the room above ours continued to dry soaking wet clothes on their balcony throughout their stay, despite the fact that it dripped down so much that they flooded our patio constantly!Seeing as they were so hot on the drying clothes on the balcony situation, they did not monitor safe behaviour in the pool or consideration in the laundry room (yes we did intend to wash and dry our clothes elsewhere once we knew where to go to). Children were left in the pool to dive in, bomb (into the jacuzzi) whilst parents were no where to be seen. Laundry was left in machines for hours after they had finished despite only 2 machines working - inconsiderate.The bar snacks were lovely, but extremely expensive. For 2 kids pizzas, a chicken wrap and a burger with 4 drinks the bill was in excess of $100.Once again, as we left the valet was extremely helpful and considerate, and remained the friendliest member of staff that we encountered in 4 days!","Dear Sharion B,Thank you for taking the time to provide us your feedback from our guests' perspective. We are disappointed we did not meet your expectations and for our staff not making you feel comfortable and welcomed while with us.

The Garland,10,"The Garland was the last hotel we stayed at the end if our California road trip. We had stayed in 5 star hotels through to 2 star hotels and expected more from this 4 star hotel. The only good thing we experienced was the free shuttle bus to Universal. Other than that I am afraid it's all negatives. When we checked in the woman who did this was on the phone talking to another client. Rule number one of good customer service is that you give the customer in from of you, your undivided attention. The lift didn't work for the duration of our stay. I don't think that that is acceptable. No complimentary water? Had to pay $6 for water in the room? Even in the 5 star hotels in Vegas you get complimentary water. We had to wait 8 minutes to be served in the bar for a beer, a glass of wine and a coke which was $30 - a little overpriced I feel and finally we had our camera stolen from the shuttle bus stop at Universal and when I mentioned it to the reception staff, whilst I know they couldn't do anything about the theft, there was no empathy or offer of help with providing contact numbers for the police or Universal lost and found. I feel that as guests of your hotel, you could have given us an amount of guidance in what was a very stressful time.All in all not a good experience and I wouldn't recommend The Garland to anyone.","Dear alexblack0212,Thank you for choosing to stay with us and taking the time to share your feedback.

The Garland,30,"If you’re looking to visit Universal Studios, then this hotel is perfect. It has a shuttle that takes you there, which is very convenient. However, for the money I paid to stay there, the value of the hotel was quite average at best. The breakfast buffet was excellent and the brunch and dinners were awesome. The staff was very kind and helpful, but the hotel is nothing special. One of the elevators didn’t work for our entire stay and the room for the price I paid, I felt should have been more impressive. The vending machines were lacking water or snacks and there was no all purpose store to buy essentials or emergency products. They did not provide us with an iron or board unless we asked for it and the room was small. I am not disappointed. The location was great if you have a rental car to get to Disney Land or Hollywood. So if you go here, expect a good location, good service from kind staff, and pretty excellent drinks and food, but not anything very special beyond that.","Dear DVMammina,Thank you for taking the time and reviewing your recent trip to LA with us. We are happy to know that you received good hospitality from our teams throughout the hotel. I hope you had a chance to try our Nutella stuffed French toast as it's one of my favorite items on our brunch and breakfast menu at The Front Yard.

The walls are thin, can hear people next to us & in the hall way. Our room was facing the freeway & was a bit loud. Bed aren't super comfy. Like the breakfast buffet.

The Garland,30,"As you can see in the pictures , the room are nicely decorated and very comfortable , our main complain was our room view which was non existent as floor one was under ground level . We were told we could upgrade this on reception however literally ten minutes later after confirming we didn’t like our original room we were told there wasn’t nothing available to upgrade... yeah weirdAlso the room was very noisy , road traffic and other guests in general could be heard so we didn’t get a great sleep. The reception area, patio restaurant and lobby bar were cute and food/cocktails were good . If the customer service experience had been better would probably give it a 4","Dear Cin V,Thank you for choosing to stay with us. We are saddened to read about your experience.

The Garland,10,"Just awful. The only good thing, and that's a struggle to say, is it's location to universal and the free shuttle, although, a taxi or a nearer hotel would do you better. That's it.It's location right next to highway 101 makes it noisy 24/7 and the double glazing is inadequate at noise mitigation.Rooms are not great, small and poor. Showers are awful and slow and trickle.The staff are rude and unhelpful. I don't want a response from the hotel as I've seen on here, such as 'contact us directly' there is no point, don't bother, I'm not coming back. The hotel is expensive and over priced. There is no Hollywood experience, it's tat and chintzy. It's got nothing going for it. Gym Is out dated too. As for the quality, you are better off staying at the Hilton up the road. Don't believe the hype.","Dear mrshuk2015,Thank you for choosing to stay with us and sharing your feedback.

The Garland,30,"Having had a testing time on the freeway from LA Airport we arrived at the Garland Hotel on Vineland Avenue, during the late afternoon. The hotel is a large one, with car parking all around its perimeter, and as is usually the case in California as you arrive you are offered valet parking or self parking. We self parked so we could place the car near to our room, but daily parking is still a round $25-30 a day. Makes you realise how lucky we are in the UK as our hotel car parks usually include parking when you stay there.Reception staff were polite and efficient and we were directed to our 3rd floor ‘Deluxe King Room’. I think I would challenge the ‘deluxe’ and the ‘King’. The room was pretty small, and had a small bathroom and very little room for clothing storage. Luckily we were only booked in for 2 days. Toilet seat was broken, but staff put this right within minutes when we rang housekeeping.We had to ask for the complimentary coffee/milk to be replenished instead of it being done as a matter of course. In fact when I first found that there was no milk I went to reception and asked for some and was directed to the hotel shop to purchase some! Not impressed.We decided to eat in the hotel restaurant that night and booked table to ensure we got in as we were told it was a popular venue. Initially we went to the bar and took advantage of the ‘happy hour’ and had a very pleasant time. The barman was very good, and chatty, and there was a good atmosphere. At the appointed time we took our seat for the meal, so far so good. The waiter seemed friendly and efficient and took our order for a started and a main course. He didn’t feel it was necessary to write it down. Some time later he came with our starters. Except, my starter was incorrect. I informed him of this and he apologised and said he would correct it but left the first started for us to share as an addition. Some time passed - and then my ordered starter came. The problem was that at almost the same time the main courses came arriving at the table by another waiter. This gave us no time to eat the starter before the main course going cold. We complained to the waiter who simply went away. The first waiter came back soon after and made apologies but nothing was done about the issue. We ended up rushing the starter and eating a ‘going cold’ main meal. This meal was of course charged to our room.I subsequently complained to reception about this incident but they weren’t interested.What was good about the hotel was the shuttle service to Universal and City Walk. Regular service on time and staffed by excellent friendly drivers. I’ve got to say that most of the staff were polite and friendly, but we were disappointed with the room and the meal incident. I can neither recommend or dissuade anyone from staying there - hopefully other peoples experiences were better, but I wouldn’t use it again.","Dear Terry W,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with us.

The Garland,30,"The Garland is a relaxed, charming hotel with very nice common areas, including the pool and the hot tub. The rooms are in a separate building that is nothing special, reminiscent of a Holiday Inn from the 1980s. The rooms themselves are fine - we were in a relatively spacious room with two Queen beds for our family of four. The balcony was a bit of a joke, though - a lovely view of a parking lot and the interstate highway.The staff was very friendly; it is genuinely a “service with a smile” place, and at night they had “dive in” movies by the pool for the kids. A very nice touch. Another nice touch was a free shuttle to Universal Studios.We experienced a few glitches: a slow check-in caused by the front desk staff not knowing how to check people in quickly and send them on their way; a check-out that was slowed down by issues with over billing - a $20 charge for a bottle of wine in the room that we did not drink, and a scramble caused by their saying that we had charged “dinner” to the room when we knew we had paid for dinner with a credit card. It was settled when we all realized that they meant “drinks by the pool” when they said “dinner.” Kind of an amateurish issue for a place that strives to be of a higher quality. And finally, the hotel provides, as any hotel in this category does, computers that allow printing of boarding passes without charge. When I tried to do that, they were broken, so I asked if they would allow me to use the “regular” internet service - which usually carries a fee - without cost to print my boarding pass. They refused, and that left a bad taste.Would we stay here again? Sure, if we were going to Universal or Warner Bros again or had business in North Hollywood. The pros outweighed the cons.","Dear dra100,Thank you for joining us and for providing some feedback on areas we may need to focus on for additional training. Overall, we do ask our staff to engage our guests at check in, as we feel its a more welcoming and personal touch that is not found at other more corporate hotels.

The Garland,20,"Stayed 2 nights with a large family group with a banquet at the hotel for 150 people. The hotel is retro chic and in our building felt a little like a motel. Very clean room but the room was very small as was the bathroom. Check in was quick and the location was great.On the second day we were out of the room by 8:30 am and when we returned at noon housekeeping had not been in. With only 3 bath towels we needed the room serviced so that we could nap and freshen up before the big night as we used the towels that morning. Hung out downstairs until about 1 and checked the room and it had not yet been serviced. I went to the desk and asked when we could expect housekeeping and I was told anytime up until 6:00 pm. I told the clerk that I had never heard of housekeeping that routinely could come so late especially since the hotel knew that many guests would need to be off site for a ceremony by about 4:30 pm. I asked that the room be serviced quickly. After another hour still no housekeeping.I now escalated this to the manager who was apologetic but it was really too late. The option of a rest prior to the evening was gone and the managers lame excuse was not credible. They apparently either do not have appropriate management in place to oversee the operation or they are inept.Obviously very frustrated as the room was finally cleaned at approximately 3:00 pm. The management appears to respond to Tripadvisor comments but their typical apology and we will work on the issue will,be to late. A simple process to allow guests to use a clean room was needed and not provided. Tons of other hotel options in the area.","Dear Medic_5,Thank you for taking the time to speak with us and providing us your feedback.

The Garland,20,"We checked in straight away after a long flight from NZ. It was confirmed that a cash deposit would be accepted as they hold quite a large amount compared to other hotels and I didnt want a few hundred held up in credit card pending transactions as when you check out the hotel tells you to call your bank and the bank tell you they are waitning for the hotel to release the funds...Upon arrival a cash deposit was not an option. They said credit card was used so we could charge to the room and to cover any accidentals (pretty sure this can be done with the cash deposit and we wernt interested in charging anything to the room)It even states on their website and booking information that cash deposit is accepted. I did try and explain this to the guy at front desk but he didnt seem to care. His whole attitude was like he had more important things to do.The property of the Garland is very pretty, it is very tidy and well kept. We were spending 2 days at Universal Studios but stayed here for 4 total as we have stayed here before and it is beautiful. The pool area is fantastic and towels avail at the pool area. There is a bar and they offer a menu as well. The fire roars at night & the hot tub is great.We caught the hotel tram up to City Walk for dinner and to Universal Studios and always tipped the drivers box, the tram is a real plus for the garland when you are heading up to the park.3 out of the 4 night our hotel hallway was full with the smell of pot and nothing was ever done. We ended up pushing the bathroom towels up against the bottom of the doors to stop the smell as I was traveling with children. The hotel does state it is smokefree.The deck doors keep all the traffic noise out for those worried how close it is to the freeway, it is close to stores (Ralphs, CVS) and places to eat.We kept our contact with reception pretty limited as they were all pretty unapproachable. The hotel grounds and valet staff were super helpful and friendly. Maybe they should switch places so there are some friendly faces representing the garland. Nothing was said when checking out. I advised them we were checking out she asked the room number took the keys and said ""thats done"" and carried on with somthing she was doing behind her.Again this is a beautiful hotel, but we felt more of a hassle to staff rather than a guest.

The Garland,30,"Based on the property as a venue for ceremony, cocktail hour, and reception, I would give The Garland five stars. It's breathtaking and we got many compliments from our guests about the property. I would book The Garland again in an instant, however I would be cautious about the service (which is why I'm giving three stars).When we originally booked The Garland, our point of contact was Jessica. We LOVED her from the minute we met her. She was always willing to go above and beyond for us, and we felt so safe with our wedding in her hands. Her role was technically that of a Sales/Catering Manager, but her demeanor had us under the impression that she was more of a wedding coordinator at The Garland. And in the end, that caused a lot of trouble for us.About three months before the wedding, we got a call from Jessica that she would be leaving her job at The Garland. We were really disappointed to be losing her, but even more so because she informed us of this ONE DAY before her last day of work. She connected us with Kayli, who would be taking over for her. To say that Kayli didn't live up to Jessica's standards would be an understatement. We had difficultly communicating with her about our needs and she would go weeks without responding to my emails, whereas Jessica would respond the same day. And then one week before our wedding day, I received a call from Kayli that she was quitting her job at The Garland too. ONE WEEK before the wedding. I was extremely panicked, but Kayli could not be less bothered by this. Christopher, the Event Manager at The Garland, took over for us. He was very responsive to my emails voicing my concerns, however he was NOT responsive to my husband and I asking how The Garland would compensate us for all of the stress they put us through. We were told that situations like this happen all the time and there's nothing they can do. We were incredibly unhappy and had it not been a week before the wedding, we would have reconsidered having our wedding at The Garland.When it came to the day of the wedding, Christopher was there, however he was not ""present."" Nor was he proactive; we always had to seek him out if we needed something, but he was never able to anticipate any issues. All of our vendors had trouble trying to find out where to go and what to do once they got to The Garland. And our DJ informed us that Christopher was not great at communicating with anyone. Both our florist and our photographer needed to get to our room at a certain time before the ceremony, and they were not allowed into the building. This caused us to run into unnecessary problems. One of my biggest issues is that at the reception, my husband and I looked over to see our vendors sitting the floor. No table was provided for them to sit at while they were eating their vendor meals. I could not have felt more shame or embarrassment in that moment. I do appreciate that the staff was able to resolve the situation when we mentioned it, however it never should have happened in the first place.We were also disappointed with the food and how long dinner service took. The food did not taste nearly as good as it did at the tasting and there were too many lulls during dinner. Many of our guests looked bored waiting for their meals to arrive.Overall, I would recommend The Garland based on the venue. However, I suggest hiring your own wedding planner to ensure that things run smoothly. And be prepared for last minute problems.","Hi Ciara,We hope you had a lovely Thanksgiving. It was such an honor to share in your special day at The Garland. We’re happy you have some beautiful memories, but am sorry to hear of the frustrations you experienced. We have discussed these items as a team to ensure we continue to improve for future weddings and events.The week of your wedding, I did email your vendors a property map highlighting the area used for your wedding, setup access, and also shared with them your timeline for the wedding. For any deliveries an associate needs to escort the vendors to the rooms as they need a special key to get into the buildings or often times guests do open the doors for easy access.Regarding vendor meals, we do arrange for a designated area to serve vendors meals – either the Green Room or the Cabanas, both outside of the Ballroom. Your vendors would’ve been notified and escorted to this area once we served their meals, but a table was requested to be set inside the ballroom, so we served them there.I am sorry you felt I wasn’t present enough. Myself and our banquet team was onsite and available the entire day for anything anyone needed and recall only one instance where Mike’s mom had asked to get some of the items I was holding for the welcome table.

Our room was ready and check in was smooth.The hotel is very close to the Universal studios and has a shuttle to take you back and forth.The room was ok but not spotless clean. there were two hairs in the bathroom sink as well as a clipped nail on the floor.Water bottle should've been clearly marked with the price, because we thought it cam in complimentary with the room especially that the room came with no breakfast, we thought the least they could offer was that water bottle.

The Garland,10,"My daughter and I picked this hotel based on the TripAdvisor reviews. Unfortunately we have not had a good experience. The service is terrible. Our first room had a low rumble that you could clearly hear and feel. We called the front desk and they said they would send someone up in 15 minutes. 30 minutes later no one had shown up. We called again. Finally someone from engineering arrived and he agreed that the rumble was annoying. So we were moved to a different room. However this room was right next to a room with a screaming toddler who woke us up at 6:45 am but we decided not to say anything. But then when we returned from our day of sightseeing, our keys didn’t work. We again had to call the front desk. A manager came and it turned out the battery in the lock was dead so even his key didn’t work. We again had to wait for engineering. Then when we finally got the door open, we saw that the room hadn’t yet had maid service. Instead of being incredibly apologetic, the manager seemed to not care a lot about our inconvenience. We will not be staying here again..","Dear kjeang,Thank you for choosing to stay at The Garland and for taking time to write the review.

The Garland,30,"Stayed for two nights for a business event. Had a double queen room in the Portola building on the 3rd floor. There may have been some kind of leak or something on the second floor because there were wet floor signs and a decidedly musty smell there. Room faced a parking lot and had a sliding door to the small balcony which allowed for fresh air. Heat/AC is one of those in-wall units so a bit noisy. Room amenities were standard. Bed was a bit hard and pillows are the kind that squish down to a hard brick. Chief complaint was the duvet set up, which was much too warm for SoCal. We are not a ""one temp fits all"" species, and a duvet with a sheet doesn't accommodate everyone. Some hotels with this setup have a lighter blanket in a closet but no such luck. On my way out after my first night, I stopped at the front desk to ask that a light blanket be put in my room when housekeeping serviced it. On my return later that afternoon, housekeeping had skipped my room for some reason but there was another duvet (making 2) on my bed. The next two hours was me calling and waiting 20-30 minutes several times for a light blanket I was assured would be brought up ""right away."" I wanted a nap before going out for the evening so I finally called and said I didn't want to be disturbed and to bring the blanket after 5:00. Settled in for a nap and drifted off only to be wakened by someone ignoring the do not disturb card and knocking on the door to finally give me the blanket (along with another duvet!). What I asked for is a basic level of service and there's no excuse for all of this difficulty. To add insult to injury, after I had checked out and left, they charged me $25 for a water and bottle of wine I never even touched.","Dear Kaydub08,Thank you for dedicating your time to share your experience at The Garland.

Then I called the next day in order to find my reservation and was put on hold for a LONG time because they have to ""go into a different system"" to find my reservation. I ended up cancelling as just too much hassle. I like to speak to someone on property directly and if I make a rez online it should be easy to make changes etc... not like this which is quite mysterious.

They have a bus that takes you to Universal studios or better still the Metro station next to it, therefore giving you access to the rest of LA. If you're exploring Hollywood, it's just one station down. The restaurant attached to the hotel seemed very expensive for breakfast but it was very good. The bar is also not cheap.

The Garland,30,Just stayed here on the advise of my travel consultant. Firstly there was nothing really bad about The Garland however nothing outstanding.Check in was fast and the lady Angel was one of only 2 friendly staff at front counter. She was amazing and cheery. All the rest who were there through out the days and nights to follow were very rude and looked like they would prefer to be anywhere else but there.As usual cleaning staff were brilliant and friendly.The room is bigger then most that we have stayed at. We had a view of the car park (awesome) and facing freeway. However not as noisy as expected. Rooms were clean and a basic room you would expect. However you can hear the neighbours talking so walls a little thin.Free shuttle to universal is probably the only reason I would want to go back and stay. It is very comvienent and the drivers are friendly.We ate breakfast once at the adjacent restaurant staff there are friendly and there French toast and pancakes of the menu are nice.Did not swim in the pool however we did see a lot of people using it.All in all if you want convenience to universal without being right next to it stay here.,"Dear Samantha S,Thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay.

The Garland,30,"This is a really cool, funky hotel tucked away in a very busy part of the city. However, it was super quiet, and the grounds were nice and it didn't feel so busy. The room was nicely appointed and the beds were comfy.My only complaint is about the people answering phones. I called a few days in advance to inquire about possibly upgrading our room since we were traveling with a few kids - and Getaway today didn't offer the family suites as part of our Universal vacation package. The person I spoke with was puzzled about the term ""upgrade the room"" and asked me, ""what do you mean?"". Then, once she determined that I had booked through a third party, she said she couldn't help me - and said it like this: ""well, you're the one who chose to book through a 3rd party"". Really? Then I called the day before to ask if they had cribs - and I was immediately told no. When we arrived, Adrian saw we had a baby and said they had cribs and would be happy to set one up for us in our room. We had already lugged a playpen from AZ and it was too late - but I appreciated his kind gesture. Garland, your hotel is too awesome and fun to be dragged down by the people answering your phones.

The Garland,30,"We purchased a package deal-2 nights in this hotel along with the VIP experience at Universal Studios. The hotel itself was ok. The room was clean and the bed was comfortable. The proximity to Universal Studios was a big factor for us (although had we known it would be so far from LAX we may have found something more half way). There is very little sound barrier between floors which can make for a lot of noise if you have an inconsiderate 'upstairs' neighbour. The location of the room also is a huge factor in terms of a restful night. We were in the Portola building on the fourth floor in room 461. It was WAY too close to the freeway for us. I sleep with earplugs and found it just too noisy to have any kind of decent sleep. There is a restaurant on site-the food was good but the hostesses were unfriendly and the wait staff was only moderately interested in providing us with service.

The Garland,30,"We really enjoyed our stay at the Garland. It is a fun, funky retro style hotel. Our daughters loved the pool. They have dive-in movies out there every night. You can order drinks and food while watching the movie. I highly recommend going on the free walking tour. There is the cutest neighborhood just a couple of blocks away, with a really great coffee shop you will go by on the tour. The room was nothing special but more than adequate. Definitely, request an interior room. We had an exterior room and the highway was a bit loud. One of the reasons we chose this hotel was their free shuttle service to Universal studios. I would say it is hit or miss. We had to take an uber back to the hotel one time even though we were at the bus stop at the right time, but no shuttle.

One object (small travel bag) inside my handbag was removed and left outside. Insted of 3 pieces I had stored, I picked up 4 pieces. Someone responsible for my luggage had opened my handbag and gone through my stuff. The luggage contained confidential and sensitive personal items like Passport, driver licence, credit cards and personal records. I was confident that the hotel would be trustworthy. I called two times to get in contact with the manager without success. What transpired from these two calls however, was that explanations of the incident changed each time and new explanations emerged depending on which employee I spoke to. This lack of response made me uncomfortable and I proceeded to close all credit cards and change passwords everywhere. When I finally reached the hotel manager he proved rude and unhelpful. Finally he admitted and explained, that the person, who had kept the bag in storage, had suffered a mishap. He claimed that lost the luggage on the floor and the extra bag popped out. How can an object popped out of locked handbag? Be aware of this.","Our entire staff takes the safety of our guests and their belongings very seriously.

I called and told the gentleman on the front desk that the smell in our room was very strong and asked him if we could change rooms and to come down to check it out himself, he said “well if you change rooms you won’t get another with a view” and he asked me to come to reception to pick up a key to check room 315, I looked at the new room and although it was dark and felt smaller than room 212, it smelt fine so we accepted it.I was surprised by the staff’s response to my asking to change rooms, I felt that I was being downgraded and frankly punished for daring to not be happy with my assigned room, despite having a 7 night booking!I have never experienced this before and feel that the staff member, an older unsmiling gentleman wearing glasses, could perhaps do some retraining in customer service. All other aspects of the hotel were good, cleanliness, facilities and resonable parking charges. I would not stay again after my experience and wouldn’t recommend the hotel to friends.",We want each and every guest to enjoy their stay with us and welcome any suggestions for improvement. Our staff is always wiling to move a guest to another room as you can see from the numerous reviews. The Front Desk agent did not mean any offense and was just trying to inform you that your new room was a corner room but still facing the pool. It is in the same category as your first room. We thank you for giving us the opportunity to accommodate you and we hope your 7 day stay was magnificent. It was a pleasure to accommodate you and look forward to welcoming you back again in the future.,,Date of stay: February 2020,"Response from SunsetPlaza8400, Director of Sales at Best Western Plus Sunset Plaza Hotel","Responded Feb 6, 2020"
Best Western Plus Sunset Plaza Hotel,30,"We stayed for 2 nights and were in town for a wedding. Our check in process was kind of a nightmare. We arrived to our room and our view was of a neighboring wall that was one foot away. We called our friends who also booked using the wedding block and they all had rooms with a view. That kinda sucked but it wasn’t too bad. But then we discovered another problem. As experienced travelers we always check the shower first thing. We turned on the shower and the water did not work. The only way to turn on the shower was to turn on the sink simultaneously but even then only cold water was coming out.We called the front desk and they said they would send over maintenance. Maintenance arrived, verified the problem and tried to fix it. It didn't work. So maintenance said they would tell the front desk and go from there. Almost an hour passed by and we didn't hear a word from anyone. Our stuff was still in the car and we just wanted to get settled already so we went up to the front desk and asked if they could just move us already. The front desk said they didn’t have any rooms available and they were working on the water problem but after a minute or two they somehow found an available room. Our room was on the 3rd floor but it was a journey to get to because since half of the hotel was under renovation we had to walk all the way through the dark, outside perimeter of the hotel and when we got to our room our shoes and luggage were dusty. Finally we got settled and luckily everything after that was smooth. If it wasn’t for the check-in debacle this would’ve been a near perfect stay but the lengthy, stressful process left a bit of a bad taste in our mouth.",Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience at our hotel. On behalf of our entire staff we would like to apologize for the inconvenience of the check in process due to our guest bathroom upgrades. The staff was surprised as you were that there was no hot water in your shower and were trying to quickly get it back on for you.

Best Western Plus Sunset Plaza Hotel,30,Unfortunately the day before we arrived we found out the pool was being worked on. I chose this hotel because of the pictures of the pool area and it was all torn apart. We were not told ahead which was very upsetting as the day before every other hotel was booked and whatever was left was extremely pricey so we had no choice but to stay I must say management tried to rectify by taking a good sum of money off. I would try again in the future but would check way ahead. It was very clean and a nice breakfast came with it b,Thank you Deb for letting others know you will definetly stay with us again.

Best Western Plus Sunset Plaza Hotel,30,"This was adequate, but I kind of regretted our choice. Our 11-year-old was uncomfortable with the location, busy street, adult-oriented. We ended up finding two decent, inexpensive places to eat dinner a few blocks away, a taco place to the right, and a nice hamburger place to the left (Burger Lounge) though. I thought the pool was kind of crowded so I was not interested in going in, but my daughter enjoyed it. Hotel seemed to be popular with European families, so there were other kids.Our guestroom was in the back, and part of the ceiling at the back was appparently a walkway, and every morning we heard lots of loud footsteps stomping right above us. The room was fine. Parking situation good, but a bit tricky to find the first time. You have to access the garage via a back road from several blocks away, though the garage is directly underneath the hotel. Lots of spaces. Breakfast was typical of hotels with free breakfasts. As others have mentioned, breakfast rooms pretty crowded, but not a big problem. We stayed 3 nights. Staff was friendly enough.Our biggest problem was with the location/neighborhood, not the hotel itself, but it definitely impacted our experience.","Thank you Saswan for taking the time to write about your stay with us.

Upon arrival our check in date was set for the wrong day, the room we were promised was unavailable, they offered only to upgrade us to what we had thought we originally booked only for a hundred dollars more in price they refused to compensate us for any of the errors that were made on their part and my $240 room ended up being a $370 with no receipt to show a break down of what I was charged for. The man at the desk who assisted us was extremely rude and over all it led to a terrible experience.

Best Western Plus Sunset Plaza Hotel,20,"Well we only arrived last night. Nice clean luxurious room nice hotel. But we were in shock when we went for breakfast this morning. Paying $300 a night should entitle us to more than disposable cutlery and plates. Besides, after breakfast we are supposed to clean our own table. Hell ho! I am not even thinking about what all this garbage does to the environment. I find it shocking that we go on a vacation to rest from caring for 22 dogs, nine horses and much more, in order to find ourselves in a place where we have to clean our own table and have to eat with bendable uncomfortable plastic knives and forks. Not even in cheap hotels when I was young did I find myself in this situation. The breakfast itself is shockingly poor, they don’t seem to have heard of fruits.

Best Western Plus Sunset Plaza Hotel,10,Worst hotel ever! I’ve used Best Western for my travels for over 10 years and never had a bad experience until I visited the West Hollywood location on sunset. The manager or receptions Frank was absolutely rude and ignorant. We had reservations and were simply checking in so we parked out front and this guy named frank came running at us saying we can’t park here and made a big scene until he figured out we had a room booked. My kids were frightened from his tone and gestures. The stay after that started horribly we weren’t getting any customer service at all. Every time we would call for room service we would either be put on a long hold or no response. Would definitely not recommend this place until they change their staff. The only nicest person was the maintenance/janitor guy. I should’ve booked room at the Andaz hotel instead.,We are sorry that we let you and your family down.

The room was adequate and comfortable but a kettle would be useful. In the morning we went to breakfast for our first meal in LA. Breakfast was served on paper plates with plastic knifes and forks which is completely unacceptable especially being in one of the the thriving cities in the world also there was no staff in sight, it was completely self service .

We were told the Saddle Chop place across the street would work however the place was packed with people watching cage fights and we couldn't get a table for over 1.5 hours. Hotel is clean albeit a bit smelly. Our room faced Sunset Blvd. and was noisy with sirens. The pool was pretty to look at but cold and seemed more like an adult pool.

Best Western Plus Sunset Plaza Hotel,10,"Upon arriving at the front of the hotel, there are steps to get inside the hotel. Steps to walk up without a ramp. When checking in there was no concern when I requested an accessible room. I politely asked for one when it became available, but was never contacted. When checking out I brought it up and they said there must have been miscommunication based on the remodel. The elevators were very tight for a wheelchair and we ended up only bringing one into the room because of room constraints. There is about 5 steps to walk up to get into the breakfast dining area so for wheelchair users it makes virtually impossible. We stayed 3 nights to attend a symposium at UCLA. This hotel was disappointing, there was no way to just stroll out the front door with the amount of stairs. The only way to exit by foot/wheelchair was the garage entrance and the down degree of that made it virtually impossible. It was disappointing that none of the staff ever addressed us, except the ladies in the breakfast lounge, who made sure to keep the hot foods well stocked, and the juices stirred. Not even when checking in was it expressed that they could be of service to just ask. They did discuss that there may be some light noise because of construction, but it was louder than what I would consider light noise.","Thank you for choosing to stay with us during the UCLA Symposium.

Best Western Plus Sunset Plaza Hotel,20,"This hotel is on sunset strip which is a busy road so the temporary parking right outside (for check in) and friendly staff was most welcome. Overall this hotel is not bad but the rooms, breakfast, facilities do let it down and do not justify the prices.Room: I would suggest certain room sizes and brightness vary dramatically. Room 316 (see photo of floor plan) is the smallest and has only a small window to allow light into so would suggest this and 116 and 216 are avoided. Also the furniture on the room was broken and what appeared to be a smoke alarm /light had a wire hanging from itStaff: Very friendly and professional. They were the highlight of staying hereBreakfast: Absolute chaos!!!! The food is basic and the room is tiny so the ability to get a table is limited (there is additional space on the fourth floor but walking up stairs with breakfast is not what I expect of a $300 (incl. Taxes) a night hotel).Facilities: The swimming pool is a little small and given its location to the buildings it is in the shade from mid afternoon onwards. There is also little space between the sun lounges and the pool that means be prepared to get splashed - Especially if there are kids jumping / diving in, despite there being no diving signs dotted up but no staff to enforce it.

Best Western Plus Sunset Plaza Hotel,30,"We recently had 3 rooms at the Best Western on Sunset Plaza at the beginning of this month (April 2015) for 3 nights. We had previously stayed at the hotel right across the street (The Andaz) and really liked the location. The difference in price between the hotels is considerable, the price difference for this short stay in LA wasn’t worth it considering we had previously felt let down by the Andaz so we decided to stay in this hotel.The check-in was quick and smooth, one small problem with one room - we were given the room key, go down to the room and immediately realise something was wrong, this room was still occupied! Reception sorted this quickly, luckily there is a safe in your room. Keep your valuables inside just in case! It was probably a one off but it shouldn’t really happen.It feels like the hotel is currently being renovated and upgraded. All 3 of the rooms had different features eg. all of them had different air con units - some were good, some bad and very noisy. Whilst we were there the TV box changed, I guess they were all being upgraded. Overall all 3 rooms were all clean and comfortable. The beds were very large and lots of pillows were given. For a short stay you can’t complain for what you get for the price you are paying - it is very good value for money.Breakfast was provided in the price, every morning it was very crowded. There is a small seated area, but you can get take out plates and go back to your room or the pool area. The breakfast was ok, it wasn’t too all of our tastes, but there were lots of options to choose from.The pool area is very nice with an almost med feel to it. Whilst we were there some members of our party used it whilst others went out shopping. It was a sun trap all afternoon, also very quiet and peaceful given the area the hotel was based in. The free-wifi was also a plus, covered the whole hotel and was a good speed.The location of this hotel is one of the best features, it’s 5 minutes walk from some really great restaurants in West Hollywood. I’d recommend Cravings as my favourite, but Cafe Med and Le Petit Four and also very good. The shopping centres (The Grove, Beverley Centre) are 10 minutes in the taxi - which luckily are always waiting outside the hotel. If I were to come back to LA I would stay in this hotel again if it was a short stay, this even over the Andaz opposite. The Andaz had small rooms, wasn’t as clean and the rooms weren’t as sound proof. The only thing the Andaz has over the Best Western is the rooftop pool, but when considering the very nice pool area at the BW I don’t see any reason to consider the Andaz before here - again, considering the price as well.",Thank you for letting us know how much you enjoyed your stay at the Sunset Plaza Hotel.

After receiving our key from the man who was half asleep at the counter we went down to our room. Entering the room, it was pretty nice, until the air conditioning unit started up and sounded like a building being demolished. Then it was time to have a shower. The shower was tiny a very dirty and outdated. Another thing were was the creaking of the ceiling from the people walking above. We had been so tied that we went to sleep on the old, dirty mattresses. The next morning we had asked if they had any other rooms. They said that they had 2 they could show us! The first room smelt so bad like smoke that my 4yo son nearly had an asthma attack, we asked to see the other room, the other room had all of its windows open and the air con running bringing in the cold LA winter. We excepted the room and left for the day. We cam back at night and all the windows were still open and the air cons on. We shut and switched everything off, sooner realising that the room, once again smelt like smoke. It was intoxicating so we sleep with one window open on these hard pieces of foam!!

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,30,"When this was the Radison they had a fabulous restaurant and well attended bar. Now its barely worth looking at the menus.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,30,Hotel was nothing special. It was clean and basic although rooms were spacious and comfortable.Its right next to the airport literally and not as convenient to downtown LA.The room rate wasnt cheap nor was it expensive for what was received.It has a bar in the lobby which is okay - saves you traveling too far and it has a restaurant and a marketplace or cafe' which was okay but very pricey which made relaxing in the environment a little dollar conscious.I stayed in the hotel for a week and it was okay but felt that the overall cost was a little too high.,Thank you for taking time to share your experience at the Hyatt at LAX!We enjoyed having you for the week and look forward to a return visit soon!,Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: February 2020,"Response from libbyzarrahy, Public Relations Manager at Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport","Responded Mar 15, 2020"
Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,20,"Number of items not up to par at this hotel, compared to its competitors right next door.1. There is no information in the room. Hotel directory contains information on earthquakes and services times for a local Catholic Church. That’s it. Information like what restaurants exist, or when hotel restaurant is open are not there. No data on hotels amenities at all. Nothing electronically provided on tv system or in room directory.2. Room service menu is extremely limited, compared to Marriott just Dow the road.3 . Lighting in the room was bizarre- took most of my stay to figure out how to turn on and off lights.4. Hotel is next to one of the largest airports in the world- with various flights leaving at all hours.....breakfast buffet opens at 6 am. Not accommodating my schedule. That could have made another 30 dollars off of me, but instead a restaurant in LAX made that money.Overall, Marriott offers a better product. Next stay, I will skip this one. If I have to pay $200 a night for a room, I expect to know where the gym is, without having to call the front desk to find out. What kind of manager allows there front desk to be clogged up calls about simple information that could be provided in a paper directory or digitally in the room.Next time, Marriott.",Thank you for taking time to share observations of your recent stay.We regret any frustration you may have experienced lacking the information stated.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,30,"This property is better than the typical airport hotel - there are a few issues - but overall a decent option.The airport shuttle is shared with the parking garage that is next to the hotel. The shuttles come by every 10 minutes or less - but - and it's a big but - they are not Hyatt people they are parking deck people. I tried to flag down the first three that went by but they didn't even slow down. They drove by terminal 2 at 30+ mph in the middle lanes, empty, and without looking for anyone at the pickup sign. My assumption is that they are paid to circle the airport and they knew another shuttle will be there in the next 5 to 10 minutes - and nobody going to a parking deck is likely to complain. But it's pathetic. Prepare to be frustrated. A lot of shuttles is great but drivers who don't get in the right lane or even slow down are worthless no matter how many times they go by.When I arrived there were two desk clerks and both looked like it was their first day (or they had never seen a computer before). I stood in line waiting for one to finish since I was next...and literally 20 minutes went by. By the time they finished with one of them the line behind me was 19 deep (I counted). Other employees kept looking out the door and then popping back in - ""not my problem"" style. This is not how a Hyatt typically operates. This is what I would expect at a Days Inn or some other 2 star airport hotel. Once I got to the desk the clerk was very fast with me so maybe it was just two difficult guests and my timing was bad. But a line that long and no manager on duty to step in??? Hyatt you can do better.The bistro is open 24 hours and serves food until 230 am. I ordered a ham and cheese and a Pepsi and it was $16. Holy crap - welcome to the Los Angeles airport Hyatt. But I have to say it was a really good sandwich. Warm, real ham and plenty of it, with melted cheese. $16 seems ridiculous - but at least the sandwich was good.The rooms are fairly small - it doesn't really feel like a Hyatt Regency - more like a 4 Points. But it was very quiet and the bed was excellent as was the A/C and the wifi so it met the need.One cp,plaint - the window shades let in a lot of light.The shuttle back to the airport tends to hit lots of traffic so allow 15 minutesBut the Clear line was fast so maybe 5 minutes once off the shuttle.Overall it's a decent option for a quick overnight. I saw lots of crew staying there. I can see why.","Thank you for taking time to share your observations of the Hyatt Regency at LAX!We appreciate the detail of your stay and will explore the commentary regarding shuttle and reception.Shuttles service the hotel 24 hours daily. You may have observed a shuttle picking up a group, and you are right that they call for back up if they are unable to stop.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,20,We had a party of 7 stay here in Dec 2019. We occupied 4 rooms that had been prepaid in November. 1 of the bookings was lost and then found again. This resulted in problems with payments and charges being applied to credit cards for the different rooms. It took a month to sort it out. We stayed just 2 nights and had the buffet breakfast for 1 morning. This had to be the most expensive breakfast I think we had all trip. Beware when going to the restaurant it's not cheap. Also those from other countries may be confused by the bed configuration. What the US call a queen bed in Australia is a double. So we had 2 very small beds. I asked for a rollaway bed but was told I could not have one. On the day of departure we had a very early departing flight. Too early for breakfast but we planned on getting something to just grab from the very small shop in the foyer. This I think from memory was supposed to open from 4am according to the in room information. Well it was not open. We were travelling with a child who needed morning medication and he needed to eat with it so fresh out of luck there. I would not recommend this hotel. There are many other airport hotels I would check those out first if you need an airport hotel stay.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,10,"The hotel and guest room were in very good condition upon my arrival. However, the room was extremely cold. The heat was more difficult to operate than any other heating system in any other hotel that I have stayed in. It included no instructions. I stayed at the hotel 1 night and checked out to go home. It took about 4 hours of wasted time waiting for the room to warm sufficiently on that visit. When my trip was extended unexpectedly, I reserved another night at the Hyatt in spite of the previous heat problem. Because of a family member who functions best in familiar situations so I took a chance. Plus, I had spent so much time manipulating the heat the previous night that I felt I knew how to operate it.After checking in and entering the room on the 2nd night, I discovered this room to be significantly colder than the first room. My family member immediately got in bed with the hotel blow dryer and used it to warm themself. I set the heat and huddled in a chair with my coat on. Finally, at 6:00 a.m. the room warmed sufficiently for me to take off my coat. As a teacher, I was my intent to use my time in the hotel to study my upcoming lessons and check student papers. While at the Hyatt, I couldn’t get any work done, nor could I get as much as 8 hours of sleep. I resumed my travel with work unfinished and money poorly spent for a sleep deprived night in artic conditions.When I informed the reservation staff of my unsatisfactory experience, I was offered free snacks as compensation.","Thank you for taking time to share your observations during your recent stay.If you would be kind enough to send your confirmation number to me directly to libby.zarrahy@hyatt.com we would like to explore the room and its ability to immediately regulate the heat and/or cooling.Should this happen in the future at another hotel, we recommend to call the reception desk immediately so that an engineer can check the function of the heat and also demonstrate to you how each guest controls the heat/air-conditioning.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,30,"My stay was for one night in a king room on a high floor. Check in was quick and easy - the shuttle took me straight from the terminal to the hotel, and I was checked in to a room on the highest floor, overlooking the runway. A great view.The room was fine, although the air-conditioner was noisy and I had to turn it off to sleep. Everything was clean and tidy as you'd expect.I had a few drinks at the bar later on and although food took an age to be delivered, the staff were friendly and it was a pleasant experience.I was in a rush on check-out and had to drop my room card in a 'drop box' in reception and race to the terminal to catch my flight. I'm not sure if this is why I'm still waiting for the $100 deposit for incidentals to be returned to my card, some 16 days after I checked in.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,10,"As a Hyatt Globalist - top tier of loyalty program - I stay at a lot of Hyatts and know what to expect of the brands, especially Regency. This particular hotel does not meet that level and is closer to a Motel 6. The pros are simple: the lobby looks pretty and the location cannot be any better to LAX. The cons however are purely outrageous. To start, after checking in, the bellman (a bald Greek or Mediterranean man) walked up to me and my clearly marked service dog and immediately said ""Nice dog, is that kind expensive?"" I skated the question and replied that she is a Boston Terrier service dog. To which he came back and said ""How much did you pay for her?"" I was a little dumbfounded at this and after a brief pause I just said ""I don't know..."" He then asked ""How old is she?"" When I told him she was nine years old, he then said ""So is she worth a lot?"" At that I started to walk away and saw him jump behind the desk. This made me incredibly agitated because I kept wondering if he was looking up my room so he could try to steal my service dog later. Despite the anxiety, I went up to the room listed on the keycard but soon found out that none of the three keys worked. So I had to go back down to the front desk to get the keys fixed while trying to protect my service dog from the creepy bellman. When we finally got into the room, we immediately noticed that you had to insert your room keycard into a slot next to the door if you wanted the power to come on like some cheep hourly motel. After unleashing my dog, I later found her eating leftover food under the bed that had not been cleaned. Then when we went to turn off the lights, we found out three out of the four light switches were broken. So to turn off the lights, we had to pull the keycard from slot next to the door to cut the power. This made things very hot at night because the AC would not turn on if the power was cut. As a Globalist, I have access to the VIP lounge that serve breakfast and dinner. The dinner service is supposed to go till 8:00PM PST, but when we arrived at 7:45PM they had already cleared down the area.The Hyatt Regency brand is supposed to be a premium luxury brand. This property is far from premium or luxury. This property is purely about convenience and should be around the level of a Hyatt Centric if it was lucky.","Thank you for taking time to share your observations during your stay.The room key slot is a sustainability initiative that you will discover in many hotels. Of course, we understand that does not rectify nor excuse the issue with the non working keys or lights.We attempt to provide genuine care to every guest who stays with us.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,30,"I'd give it 3.5 stars if I could. Since the overall rating is 4 stars, I went for 3 to average it out. Too many reviews of this place (and everywhere) are for 5 or 1 star.There is not a single thing about this hotel that would prevent me from returning. There's also not a single thing that would make this an automatic top choice when staying by LAX.The good: the shuttle service is really excellent. The rooms are pretty spacious and higher floors have a nice view. I also appreciate that there are sufficient outlets and power ports by the bed. The pool is large. And if you have lounge access, it is spacious and not overcrowded.Not as good: Instead of a desk, the rooms have a round table with two funky and not so comfortable chairs. The water pressure in the bathroom is anemic. The in room fridge didn't work and although I called, no one tended to it during my entire six day stay. While I like the pool, I was sorry there was no hot tub. They certainly have space for one. And part of the reason the lounge felt spacious was that the offerings were not good. When the complimentary breakfast falls short of a Hampton Inn, you almost shouldn't bother.Biggest strength is the shuttle. Biggest weakness is the water pressure. I'd start here again if the price was right, but there are a lot of options on the strip with their own passes and minuses.","Thank you for taking time to share your observations during your recent stay.We appreciate the detail of your review and regret any disappointing aspect of your stay.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,10,"Waiting for the shuttle for more than 15 minutes, I did not know if I missed the shuttle or if I am at the wrong waiting stop. All other hotel shuttles from Marriott had passed. The Marriott shuttles will enter at the post labeled 6C and then to the post labeled 6D to pick up customers. I stand between posts 6C and 6D to make sure I can easily go to 6C or 6D depending on where the shuttle stopped. I then used my phone to call Hyatt to ask what color their shuttle was. While on the phone, a shuttle labeled white and purple was on the far lane and did not even go to the curbside near 6C and was ready to past 6D until I had to run to the third lane to signal the driver to pick me up. By the way, I had three luggages with me. So you can imagine how hard it is to leave the baggages in the curb and risk getting hit by cars to go to the third lane to signal to the driver that I am a customer. And when the driver came down, he had the rude nerve to scold me that he was honking and I am not paying attention. He did not know I was on the phone with Hyatt. And he also thinks I am supposed to knowhe was honking for me. Most tourists would not know what color the Hyatt shuttle is. And he is not the only car honking. I explained to him that all shuttles will go to the inner curb by the time they approach 6C in case there is a customer and then stay on curbside until 6D. He stubbornly disagreed and was still rude and arguing with me. He later extended his hand to shake me after I told him I will report him. I never reported him. I forgive him only because I am Catholic. But Hyatt's shuttle service really deserves a 1 star rating versus Marriott.","Thank you for sharing your experience.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,30,"Room was nice and clean, big TV and the bed was comfortable, hotel close to LAX.Restaurant and sncak shop were less than average, poor food choices, lackluster service.Parking was not free anywhere, very expensive worse if you wanted to leave the hotel by car.

We are located at the 4th largest airport in the world, and the demand on parking is signficant. Valet Parking is $55.00 per night, under the care of the hotel. There are several public lots surrounding LAX that are equally priced but not as convenient as Hyatt.When visiting the hotel in the future please ask for dining and shopping recommendations.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,30,"The location is fine if you are wanting to be near the airport which I did as my business trip was 4 days in and out, and did not want to be bothered driving to the car rental and airport on departure day. I had a very clean room with a partial runway view on the 5th floor. The room was sound proofed so I did not hear any airplane noise thankfully. If you have the ATC app on your phone, the LAX ATC for runway 24 L & R is "" LAX Tower North"". I actually sat there listening to the tower clear Jets and watched them immediately depart as well as land, very cool stuff! The fitness center is on the top floor and overlooks the entire airport, which was also really cool. The pool looked beautiful as well, big and clean. Nice lobby with a restaurant that I stayed away from for reasons you will understand later. That's it for the goodness of this hotel. The rest was pathetic. $48 per day to valet park a car for a Hotel guest - yes you many come and go at your leisure for the $48, but it is completely absurd. $21 each time you go in or out of the self parking lot for a hotel guest. So if I go out and have to come back for something, its $21 out and another $21 when I go out again. Again, absurd. Clean but tiny room containing basically the same amenities as say, a mid priced motel. Above my refrigerator there were 2 bottles of cheap Dasani water, each with tags on them stating that I would be charged $4.00 for each bottle if I was not a member of Hyatt something or other. No microwave oven in the room, small refrigerator that made an irritating noise. Then there was the struggle to get food delivery upstairs every night for dinner because you need a key to use the elevator to get upstairs, and the hotel staff were too lazy to go with the driver to the elevator and let him come upstairs. The one night I ordered hotel room service, the food was disgusting and WAY overpriced. I ordered a double cheeseburger, Caesar salad (sent up with some kind of thousand island tasting pink dressing?), Asian noodle soup with slices of pork fat in it, and 1 melted scoop of Breyers ice cream for a whopping $63.00. I mean when I see the name ""Hyatt Regency"", I think luxury, not stingy, skimpy with little standards. In the room was a coffee machine with Starbucks disgustingly strong coffee, and it came with only 1 small pack of powdered creamer and 2 equal type sweeteners, 4 packs of sugar that nobody eats nowadays, basically equaling undrinkable coffee. Thank god for Door Dash and IHOP LOL, they were not stingy and delivered me half and half and extra equals with my coffee. I would not stay here again, can get a nicer hotel for the same or less money in the area.","Thank you for taking time to pen your recent stay.While we perceive we met or exceeded certain expectations, we regret we disappointed you on others.To offer some insight to your comments parking offered at the hotel is valet at $55.00 per night and is closest to airport terminals. Self parking adjacent to hotel is often used for meetings or overnight stays that are for travelers not requiring multiple in and out.Water bottle consumption in the guest room is optional with a variety of choices in our unity la 24 hour market. There are 2 microwaves in unityla market available 24 hours. Microwaves are not featured in guest rooms due to the consideration they can leave odors that impose on guest comfort.We will share your comments regarding your food service with our culinary and service team.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,20,"We chose this hotel because we were flying out of LAX the next day so we only stayed here for one night.

We called and they said the hotel was sold out for the night, but somehow were still able to move us to a new room (not really sure how that works). The new room was better, but the counters were still dirty with coffee stains and other marks. It just seemed like they came in to switch the sheets (hopefully) and that was it for cleaning. It seemed like the rooms were updated recently but get a lot of use and housekeeping isn't able to keep up.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,30,"The good:You can walk from Terminal 1 (Southwest) in about ten minutes.The staff is great.

Cold modern and unwelcoming.The bistro food area was very confusing.Window shades ( a blackout and drape) are controlled by two hard to use chain pulleys.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,20,"Let me preface this review with some context. We travel a lot and have increasingly used Hyatt properties as they have been a touch above other chains. A priority for us is a nice lounge where we can get a healthy breakfast at our own pace. In addition, we enjoy a cocktail in the evening with a nice variety of hot and cold snacks.With a few days in LA we decided to use the LAX Hyatt as our base. Checking in around 9:30 PM, after dropping our bags we were told at check-in that if we hurried to the lounge there would be drinks, snacks, and desserts until 10 PM.Sitting in the club, we decided this was a great choice. The coffees, yogurts, and cakes were great.Exhausted, we headed for bed. The room was lovely, fresh and spotless with a firm mattress, nice linens and even 1 bathrobe.THEN we tried to turn on the TV. No service. They offered to send an engineer we requested a new room even though we had to repack.Breakfast in the lounge was excellent with an adequate healthy breakfast including a hot egg dish, oatmeal and a great variety of fresh fruit and yogurt.On entering the lounge in the evening we found a few fresh and grilled vegetables, two cheeses and 2 types of crackers. Only beer and wine available, no cocktails even though this is an honor bar where you pay for anything you take or pour. We ate a few pieces of cheese with crackers and went out with NO COCKTAILS, for dinner. On our return at 8:30 for dessert cakes, we found them gone. When we complained to the staff member that evening we were told the hotel was implementing new Hyatt policy- no cocktails, no hot dishes, and as we learned no variety in what is offered every evening.Tonight we again went back after dinner out to have wine and cheese at 7:30 and the same evening staff member said - sorry the cheese was gone. A fellow guest (Globalist) said the cheese was gone when he arrived at 7:00. Having been told by concierge staff that everything on the new minimal offerings provided should be available until 8:00 and desserts until 10. We commented on the sparse servings that we as guests had essentially paid for and, after a civilized argument the attendant agreed to call the kitchen and a platter of Brie arrived 15 minutes later.Other issues- the single bathrobe was removed after the first night and never replaced even though requested of staff cleaning the rooms in the AM and a call to housekeeping 24 hours later.If Hyatt, as a chain, is indeed making this their new level of lounge service, we will rethink our hotel choices going forward.The AM lounge staff by the way, were friendly, knowledgeable and very helpful on all three days and the staff member in charge on our first evening was extremely accommodating, as well.","Thank you for taking time to share your observations during your stay.We appreciate your candor and will explore the observations you shared. It is always our intent to meet everyone's travel expectations with genuine care.When traveling to Los Angeles, please alert me at libby.zarrahy@hyatt.com so I might lend to your pre-arrival arrangements.

Hyatt Regency Los Angeles International Airport,30,"I was excited for the opportunity to give the Hyatt Regency a visit - as I am a Hilton Diamond member and wanted to break my normal travel routine. I should have just stuck with Hilton.First the ""Best"" experience part of the review.ROOMS: Holy smoke! Rooms were outstanding. Latest tech - everything worked (except the small bedside lamp on the left side of the bed (as you are standing in front of the bed) - never could figure out how to turn that light on). The TV (the TV itself...not the channels and engineering....see below for that), the bed, the sound-proofing, the USB plugs and outlets....the lighting, fast WiFi (and no ""sign in"" requirements).....all were remarkable. The bathroom is amazing as well - especially the shower......great water pressure, hot - and just a nice and new shower (and doors work perfectly and doesn't flood the floor like other hotels). The refrigerator is cold, the couch is roomy - and if you get a floor high enough (on either side) you can watch the Runway traffic.LOBBY: Brand new, roomy and a fun place to gather with friends. Food and drink both very good.Now, for the ""Worst"" experience part of the review.Parking - Part 1 - Fee. DO NOT PAY the $35 bucks a day! Had I known that the Third Party Vendor Garage that the hotel uses (directly behind the hotel) only charges $19.95 (+tax) a day - for parking - I would have simply paid them. What is the $15.00 mark-up for? I don't mind paying for parking at hotels - price of doing business - but, an unnecessary mark-up. There is no in-n-out privileges with the 3PTY Garage itself - but if you are leaving just once - each day during your stay - it is the same price. If you are going to leave and come back, multiple times in the same day - then you probably have to use the Hotel $35 day pass. BUT, the Hotel needs to explain that at check-in (if there happens to be a different price for no in-n-out, I was not made aware....I was told that I needed to get the day pass in order to leave the garage and come back).Parking - Part 2 - Operations. So, in order to get in-n-out (I was staying 2 days and needed to leave on Day 2 for business, and then return in the evening)....I was told I needed a day pass. A painful ordeal. I have to go park, bring the ticket back to Valet - they do their thing - giving me back my original ticket plus the day pass - with verbal instructions. I followed the instructions given, but the ticket machine coming into the garage on Day 2 would not accept the day pass (kept rejecting it and actually spitting it out onto the street....lol). Contacted the garage personnel via intercom and was told to ""press the button for a ticket"" and enter the garage. I did that, but upon return to the Hotel, I checked with the Valet to advise them their ticket/instructions did not work. So, I had to walk over (with the Valet Manager) back to the garage manager to address the problem and get the ticket ""re-set"". For-the-love-of-Hyatt......the guest should not have to be doing this......the parking should work, as advertised.....especially if I am paying a $15 surcharge.....it should definitely work - and I should not be the person resolving it. Check the video feed for the garage....you will get a laugh out of seeing the ticket spit out, repeatedly - and me getting out of my car, several times as well.TV Channels (Engineering). So, I was assigned RM 850. Great room as described above. But, when I went to tune in my 2 favorite channels - neither had a ""signal"". Thought this was odd, checked some other channels - and it was hit-n-miss on channel availability. Contacted front desk - who were extremely helpful - and they sent up an Engineer who advised me ""Oh yeah, these rooms on this side don't get many of the channels from 16 and above"" ----- I got a laugh out of that. So, what Hyatt is telling me is that there is a known defect with a set of rooms, buttttt we will sell them anyway (revenue is revenue). I was told that I could watch just the local channels (again I laughed).....I declined stating that I would like the option to watch the higher cable channels. So, my option was to move (to Room 740) - and everything in that room worked perfectly.FEEs - FEEs (and more FEEs). So, upon initial check-in at 1230ish, I was advised that there would be a $10 fee for checking in before 1pm (never heard of that before at other LAX hotels, and I have stayed at the Hilton, Sheraton and Renaissance). East coast flights come in early - due to time zone change - and zapping a guest $10 bucks is just embarrassing for the property. $10 is not that big of a deal - but why charge it. Well, because they live on ancillary fees. So, I then asked for the highest floor assignment possible and was told that would be an extra $40 dollars a day for a high room assignment! I didn't ask for a room upgrade - I just asked to be assigned the highest floor possible based upon my rate--if the 3rd floor is as high as I can get, then I wanted a room on 3.....but the hotel immediately thought ""more fees"". So, the initial check-in attempt went poorly. I departed for a meeting, returned at 830pm, and that check-in went much smoother (until the room change described in the previous paragraph).Overall - I was kind and gave 3 stars (primarily due to the brand new rooms, brand new lobby and professional staff). And, as you can see from my number of reviews, I travel - a lot - and will have to stick with Hilton when visiting LAX area in the future. The standard ""cut-n-paste"" scripted responses on Trip Advisor don't really address the problems and concerns that guests address in their reviews (the response from the hotel is just a ""check-in-the-block"" that the hotel responded to the reviews that posted that day). I have Hyatt a chance.",Thank you for taking time to offer such a detailed overview of your stay.We genuinely care for each and every guest who comes into our hotel and it appears we have several opportunities to services easier and enjoyable.

Nice place , I was very please actually for the first 3 Minutes at my arrival at 2:00 pm.How can I start this disappointment. First of all our first room floor number 8 had the room all dirty, couch full of stains and god knows what else. It was literally nasty. The bed has also some stains , desk full of dust, bathroom mirror full of stains . Worst thing was the fridge , smelled like a death animal inside, it was just horrible. We got switch after 20 minutes to a Lower floor , the room looked semi ok , still not appropriated for a “ 4 star hotel, but I just wanted to enjoy my trip and forget about the nasty scenario. I went from a suite on the 8th floor to a regular room 5 floor. I told the "" manager"" to come in a take a look at the nasty room from The 8 floor by the way and she declined. Also , If this a "" four star "" hotel , there should be NO guest smoking weed right in front of the hotel . Every single morning I went for a run and I saw the same thing different people. Why there was no security around? Is this a place I will take my family to? Hell no , I wouldn’t like my children to see this. It doesn't give a good vibe to people that decided not to do drugs to see people smoking weed in front of a 4 star hotel. There was literally 10 people at 8:35 a.m. smoking weed right in the corner of the hotel. I was not also disclosure about the house keeping thing because of COVID , is just ridiculous. Think about it ! You have to clean for the next guest either or, but I understand. What I don't understand is the disclosure part. I am very disappointed , the guest smoking was the worst part. I also had an issue with my key at 10:00 pm after coming back from a hiking tour and being around the city. I had to wait about an hour to go back in my room. It seems like the hotel has a lot of issues. I would not recommend this to a family member or friends. It is definitively a place to be at , specially if you expect 4 start treatment.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"Seeing as there is currently a pandemic happening, I wanted to give this Hotel the benefit of the doubt. Although the lobby of the hotel is a sight to see, the room was very dusty. I actually had to call and request that housekeeping come back and dust everything over. Which made me worry whether the room was really sanitized (I ended up wiping everything down with Lysol wipes). Secondly, the shower head holder was broken, so I had to hold the shower head the entire time while taking a shower. Last but not least, the Air Condition does not blow heavy air. I woke up soaking wet due to being extremely hot throughout the night. For this being a 4 star hotel, there are many things just not up to standard (the pictures shown on websites isn't what you'll get once you're in the room).

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"While the staff was incredibly kind and responded well to our issues, it was disappointing to stay in a not very clean hotel. Our original room had dirty sheets and we were upgraded to a new room for the inconvenience. The furniture looked dirty and stained in both rooms. We also didn’t get housekeeping service during our two night stay. After a long day it was frustrating getting to a room with the bed not made and no fresh towels. Staff offered to send new towels but that was it. Not worth the price, quality was low , if it wasn’t bad cause of the front desk staff (Andrea, who was very kind, and the manager Carla who was the one who gave us the upgrade) , I would have demanded a refund the moment we saw our dirty bed sheets","Dear Manuela M,Thank you for staying with us recently, and for taking the time to share feedback regarding your stay. I apologize for your experience here and that we did not deliver upon all aspects of our IHG Clean Promise. For the safety of our guests, we do attempt to limit entry into our guest's rooms, and therefore service rooms after the fourth night of a guest's stay. However, should a guest request more frequent housekeeping service, we will absolutely provide it, given that our guest is not present in the room while it is being serviced. I am very sorry that we did not explain this better to you when you upon your arrival, and that we did not provide you with the frequency of Housekeeping service that you expected. I will follow up accordingly with our Service Team, and I will use your feedback as a training tool for better communication.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,10,"Where to start... The pool and fitness center were closed for my stay, despite no indication at the time of booking. It seems the only ""amenity"" spared from closure was the $48/day valet service.I wasn't given any of the typical amenities/upgrades that I'm accustomed to receiving as an IHG platinum member (these aren't guaranteed, but the hotel seemed to have plenty of availability during my stay).The room was not stocked with any glasses, bottled water, etc. I called the front desk to ask for 2 drinking glasses, but I was told to use the paper coffee cups in the room.These, combined with a number of other small oversights, led to an overall disappointing experience.","Dear Matt,Thank you for your continued loyalty to IHG, and for staying with us recently, and also for taking the time to share feedback regarding your stay.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,10,"My husband called ahead for an earlier check in and was informed it would be taken care of. He is handling calls for aiding in covid-19 relief and is one of the many people staying at the hotel in addition to first responders that are working to help during all this. He requested early check in to be able to work in the room over the phone. Upon arriving the receptionist this morning was incredibly dismissive about our adjustment to check in early but was quick to offer us an upgrade to the executive suite. We have waited in the lobby for over 5 hours for our room to be ready, requesting multiple times for the music to be turned down to a level not that of a dance club since there are multiple people in the lobby who are working. All of the facilities and areas in the hotel to work are closed so the lobby is the only place, which has loud speakers in every corner. We walked to find some sort of quieter seating outside and couldn’t find anything. Nearby park is closed. The hotel is located next to a very busy road and any nearby business (that is open) isn’t allowing anyone to sit inside due to the virus. It’s been incredibly frustrating how things have gone here today and we haven’t even had a chance to check in to our room yet. The other front desk staff with the exception of the valets were also very dismissive, putting it politely when really they just don’t want to get up or to be of help of any kind. I don’t recommend staying here.","Dear Emily,Thank you for providing us with this feedback, and for staying with us here at Hotel Indigo.

Nothing being wiped down or vacuumed. The garbage cans in the valet area were completely overflowing with cups on the ground at the entrance to the hotel! I did not receive a single visit from housekeeping and I was there for 4 days! By the time I left I had no clean towels, overflowing garbage, no shampoo, no coffee for the Keurig, no change in bed linens,,,, The carpet in the hallway literally had stains all over it and looked like there was a pile of vomit in the corner buy the elevator.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"We stayed in a room close to the elevators on the 10th floor as that was apparently the only room they had, needless to say that we didn't get much sleep at all and the hotel staff were aware of noise issues associated with these rooms when I called the front desk. We were in this room with our 9 year olds, so you can imagine how crabby we were after a night of little sleep and guests walking the halls loudly at 2am, I assume after the club ended on the 18 Social. We were given a breakfast voucher (1) per person to apparently apologize for the lousy sleep.Oh I forgot to mention the disgusting sheets that we had to ask to have removed/replaced, and also the prior guests hair in the shower and on the toilet!We were moved to another room on the same floor, but told they only had a room with a special bathroom for accessibility. We were not happy with these accomodations due to needing as much space as we could get for kids and ourselves. We moved yet AGAIN!After this, we were moved to our third and final room, which we were finally happy with and were able to sleep through the night!Apparently in the shuffle of moving multiple times, we lost the breakfast vouchers and get this, the front desk didn't believe that we were given vouchers and in front of my kids began to question the validity of my request to have the cards replaced. WOW! The front desk person spoke to the manager and then said they could accommodate breakfast - by the time she was done speaking to the manager, there was about 10 minutes left of breakfast service! She then proceeded to tell us breakfast was close to the end and that we should hurry. We were able to have one serving before they cleared the buffet!So, imagine my disappointment at seeing that we were charged for breakfast $100.85 upon our return. After the humiliation of being questioned about whether we had vouchers. I called the hotel a few minutes ago to question the charge and you know what they said 'well, you lost the vouchers'.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,10,"Let me get right down to it, this hotel has a modern chic boutique vibe in décor only. I was left underwhelmed by both, the staff and amenities in the room. The customer service at the valet and the front desk was terrible. When pulling up to valet we were welcomed by someone barking its $44 to park here and we were rushed out of the car as they unloaded the bags but didn’t bother to bring a bellhop cart to assist us. So, we carried our bags to the front desk who was clearly not trained in customer service. No pleasantries, he immediately tried to push a $50 room upgrade and didn’t give us any hotel information. Front-desk normally explains where the pool/gym/bars are located, wifi passwords, how to contact the front desk and concierge via text. None of this information was offered, he merely said, elevators are to your right. He didn’t even tell us our room number!! There is no way this is a four-star hotel.The mini-fridge and AC were so loud!!! Clearly, these appliances were on their last leg. Lighting in the bathroom is horrendous, so forget looking glam unless you bring your own light. Mold in the shower, towels were surprisingly stiff (haven’t felt a towel that cheap in years), one-ply tissue and toilet paper. Again, this is not a four-star hotel by any means!The only positive is the location. It’s walkable for Staples Center and DTLA Mall, but there are so many hotels in this area that offer the same convenience. If you expect luxury stay at the Ritz or customer service (I can’t believe I’m saying this) pick a name brand hotel. I would never stay here again.","Dear Oceababe22,Thank you for taking the time to provide us detailed feedback.

I studied hospitality during college which I understand how hard to work in the customer service position and I am always an understanding person but I also don't like it when people get treated differently.I do need to give Karla a shout out since she is the only one was able to help me get my problem solved after the other 2 people I experienced earlier. The only reason i am not giving a 1-star review is because of her.The first lady was really rude and no emotion on her face when I approach to the front desk. I ask her for adding guests to my room and showing inpatient when I spelling the name. when I show her my phone and trying to give her the names, she just pushed my phone away and said she cannot read it because she doesn't have her glasses. I arrived around 10AM and I totally understand that the check-in is normally in the afternoon. But she didn't even tell me they can text me when my room is ready which offered my colleague the service. I came for a business meeting and the conference starts at 1PM, So i asked whether I can get access to a locker room or gym to change my clothe and the only option she offered is the hotel restroom in the lobby and there is even no disability restroom to have more room in changing clothe.Approaching 12PM, My colleague got the text message saying his room is ready so i went back and check mine. we checked in at the same time with the same type of the room and i am even an IHG member. The blonde lady who helped me also didn't seems like she is happy, said my room won't be ready until 4PM. I asked why he can get his room and she said he probably has a different type and have a different request. Again, I am just asking questions and her attitude is not friendly but more as I owe her something.The room is nice but there is no customer service.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"When we arrived there was a queue in reception but we were offered water while we waited, which actually wasn’t very long. Susan checked us in - very friendly and helpful about the local area. We arrived early but were allocated a room straight away.We were told was that if we wanted to use the bar/club on the top floor, it would have to be today as it was closed for private events for the following 2 nights. Didn’t bother us but it would have if we’d taken our daughters with us.Our room was very nice, spacious and clean on the 16th floor. Bed was comfortable. Shower was good. Coffee facilities, safe, USB ports. There are ample, fast lifts.Good location for restaurants and trains. We also had a car and used the valet parking. The valets and girl on the door gave the best service in our experience, even though they were constantly on the go.It takes a while for reception to answer the phone if you ring down and they didn’t always understand what we were asking for, despite us all speaking the same language. When we were checking out we rang twice during 40 minutes requesting a bellboy and for our car to be brought. Housekeeping knocked the door and we said again we were waiting for help with our cases. In the end we took our 3 large suitcases down ourselves and there was no car waiting. No one knew anything about the phone calls.Housekeeping cleaned well but were hit and miss with replenishing toiletries.We ordered food and drinks once from the bar and this was a fail. Initially there was no one serving at all so after a few minutes my husband had to go and find someone. After placing the order with a now surly barman, which was just tacos, chips and wine, we found a seat. Then a waiter came with the wine and to clarify whether we wanted to order food - which we already had. He was very apologetic and a few minutes later arrived with chips, which were cold, - tacos to follow.....he then replaced the cold chips. He did apologise for the confusion but I’m not sure what could’ve got confused in all honesty.On our check out day we thought we’d spend time at the pool as we weren’t checking out until 3. While we and 2 other guests were sun bathing hotel staff started packing up sun beds around us, even moving one lady’s belongings off a bed whilst she was swimming until eventually there was only us left and we were asked to leave as the pool was now closed for a private event. I was actually asked if I was part of the event and responded with ‘no, I’m just a hotel guest which it seems doesn’t count for much’.We also booked a bus tour through the hotel, LA Tours, which was dire - holes in the seats, no headphones so you couldn’t hear the driver (Open Top). Not worth the $150 we paid - before tip. I think they should be aware of tours they are recommending.We took a train to Universal Studios which was easy.All I can say is it’s a nice hotel if you’re not counting on making use of the pool or upstairs bar. Not a patch on Hotel Indigo, Rome.","Greetings GailG701,Thank you so much for taking time leaving a detailed review on your experience.We are glad that despite it was a busy day for us and there were a queue at check in, our Front Desk staff had turned it to a pleasant check in experience for you.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"Evaluating the hotel alone it's a solid 4.5. Our room on the 13th floor was spacious for 3 of us (my wife and 17 year old son). The walk in shower with high pressure shower head (like the highest pressure shower head I've ever seen) is luxurious and the décor is sleek and modern. The staff is great - polite, enthusiastic, very helpful (but the car valets get overwhelmed at times). 4th floor ""rooftop"" pool offers fantastic views and is in the sun most of the day (at least in late August). The fitness room is spacious and has plenty of equipment to offer.But downtown LA theoretically is close to everything - except it's not and there is nothing in DTLA unless you're there for business or the Staples Center - many restaurants and businesses are closed on the weekends (but yes many are open) - but you really don't want to dine/shop in downtown anyway.So while it's ""close"" to West Hollywood, Beverly Hills and other touristy spots - it's LA and it takes forever to get anywhere. 1 hour to UCLA which 10 miles away, 30-40 minutes to WEHO/Beverly Hills/Hollywood which 6-8 miles away. The beach? At least an hour. Griffith Park - 45-60 minutes. And never mind parking, which is scare and pricey, and mass transit, which is not expeditious. LA's exhausting.So for the price (you pay for the 4.5 rating) and the location, it brings it down to a 3. I'd stay closer to where I primarily want to visit. I'd even move around to different hotels if I were doing different things in different areas. The only plus about the hotel is that is easy to get on/off Highway 110 (but that is erased by being between 10 and 101 so it's constantly at a crawl).","Thank you, dchen666!We truly appreciate you taking the time to write a detailed review.

Unfortunately the door to our bathroom did not close, we also had issues with no spoons being left for the tea and coffee by the maid. We were given an apology for these issues and one nights refund. However on the last night we had no spoons again. Then when we came to check out somome had charged food to our room. While we had a good stay, getting the basics right like hotel inventory, shutting doors and ensuring secure room charging should be a priority. I suggest offering the option to block charges to my room, as I always prefer to pay as I order.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,20,"Don’t plan on using the pool here. Outdoor space at the pool is extremely limited to begin with, add in the fact that they close off two thirds of it for corporate events and you have two umbrellas and 10 chairs for the entire hotel. When we asked the manager for a solution, she pretty much said we were out of luck. There is clearly no concern for guests and she didn’t do anything to make up for it. There was no offer of any sort, or even the slightest hint of caring about us not having access to the amenities of the hotel. Basically we can sit in the hotel lobby or our rooms.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,20,"I stayed at the Indigo in downtown Los Angeles in June, 2019 and was very disappointed. I am an IHG member which seemed to make no difference at this below average establishment. The front desk staff was very rude, despite the fact that they weren’t busy. I can’t imagine any reason every member of the front desk would be rude other than the fact that perhaps they are overwhelmed. This isn’t right either but I’d have let it go.The room was a nice size but wasn’t as clean as it should’ve been. The bathroom was spotless. The hotel itself looks as if it were originally a lower end property that’s being shoehorned into something it can’t be without more renovation to bring, for example, more light into the hallways. The lobby is very noisy.Because I stay at hotels so often I give newer hotels/renovations a bit more latitude especially when chains have decided to go with an ‘Ikea’ theme...a norm these days... and that are also centrally located in transitioning areas. But service beyond the pale can not even remotely be seen as an issue. Cleanliness is also, always nonnegotiable.","Dear 'Surfbaby2016',we appreciate your honest feedback a lot. I would love to have you back one day to show you that your stay was not typical.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,20,"Stayed here for 5 nights. All Reception Staff we encountered unfriendly and rude. The nicest staff were the door men/women and greeters. Hotel in a good location only for arriving/departing as next to freeway. But a very poor area while located & getting around. Unfortunately next door to a Salvation Army station where LA's poorest & forgotten hang about day and night. Not somewhere you feel safe both during day and at night. Not much around this hotel except the Staples Centre with its surrounding overpriced chain restaurants. Very disappointed with this hotel as it's reception staff let it down badly - they were only interested in the ""flashy"" people and not your normal folks. Would not recommend and would not go back. Hotel room not very clean - found crumbs all over table and floors. Also found makeup marks on bed clothes and mildew in bits of bathroom. Only full length mirror in bathroom and this is only location the hairdryer would work. More than 1 person can't get ready at same time - not good layout. Cocktail bar had private party in area so wouldn't allow in - not enough seats to admire view advertised. Overpriced hotel very poor.","Dear April S,I want to thank you for your detailed feedback.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"We wanted a hotel that was walking distance to the Staples Center as we were in town for a Clippers-Lakers game. For that reason alone, Hotel Indigo was the choice (as the Ritz is beyond our budget). So I give the place an A for location. But as far the rest of the aspects we look for in a good hotel, this place falls short of the vibe it's trying to present. Bath towels (C-) were small, thin and cheap. Water pressure was poor (C) and shower-head placement was only suitable for five-footers. Soundproofing (C) was poor. No free coffee and tea in the lobby. The concierge was useless on finding suitable eateries nearby. And by the way, the decorative hats in the lobby are in serious need of dusting.","Dear BlueBoots,thank you very much for your comments.

Karima (Karina?) was a super pleasant person to check in with and I thought it was the start of a good two night trip. Problem is, she was the only good thing about it.I was told I will get upgraded to the club floor. Assuming that it was a lounge, I thought how convenient. Now, its a CLUB. Full of 40-50 year old out of towners getting away from families trying not to hurt themselves. The view is nice though.. One hallways away, the thumping is so bad I could hardly watch TV. asked to see another room and the other room was still one floor under and just as bad. Dont come to this hotel if you need rest.No water was in the room. Played a cat and mouse game with the front desk to assure them no water was in the room. Finally got some water after a 10 minute talk when I actually went to the front desk.Water pressure.. is almost non existant. for the shower. the hot water also takes a while and reminds me how much water I wasted while getting it to warm up.valet.. well.. kind of a bummer and hit or miss. they open doors for some people or they too busy on thier phones for others. I asked them to pay attention for an uber coming one day and sure enough uber in driveway but valet hanging out with female guests.lobby bar was ok. nothing special. its hardly the kind of place you would go to sit and relax. service is non existent and constantly going up to the bar to order. even felt so bad i cleared my table and the table next to it so people who were waiting can feel comfortable sitting.location is awesome. Right next to Staples and a bunch of food selection.Check in and check out was smooth since it was a prepaid room. Karima / Karina is the shining star. She was happy, professional, quick, and just such a good example of everything that this hotel has potential for.Probably wont stay here again.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"Just based on the photos, this place is excellent with funky rooms, reasonably good lobby and bar area, a nice lounge upstairs and a decent gym. Easy walk to Staples Center as well. It's the overall experience though that is a let-down. For me, it was the beds that sink in the middle, cheap split system air-cons in the rooms, a fresh air vent that blows directly on to your face while sleeping that can't be turned down or off, and being woken up three times out of six mornings by housekeeping who never quite got the just that we generally weren't ready by 8 am. Even on our checkout day (surely there's a system for that?). Customer facing staff in general aren't overly courteous either.","Thank you 'pmaraun',We appreciate your feedback. I am sorry to read your experience was not great.Our AC system looks like a split unit but is actually a VRF system. It is quieter and more powerful than traditional hotel PTEC systems.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"Hotel itself was nice, convenient location, restaurant just great (waiter, don't remember her name, is really great). But billing looks suspicious.The hotel is not inexpensive, so it is quite high rate but it seems like they trying to charge as much as they can. Let me explain.My receipt stated I should pay $1569.05 (includes additional charges like dinner and parking). Instead they charged me $1571.32 (just $2.27 difference - not a lot). I've contacted them saying there is a mistake on my bill, please adjust the amount. Instead I got 'an updated copy of my receipt' that included this additional charge $2.27 as a 'package overall charge' which hasn't been included it the original receipt.Well, okay, I never got an explanation of what this additional charge was for. I sent two emails to the same agent that replied to me first time with 'updated copy of my receipt' but haven't heard anything after that...(in case if Indigo would like to respond and doesn't want to lose the guest, I am still willing to read your explanation.)This is why I think overall rating shouldn't be higher than average.They have something to work on.Also, there is a common note in the room - saying let's help the planet, if you wish your towels to be washed, leave them on the floor. So, we did not want our towels to be washed, we left them as they are but they changed them. Next day I left a note in the bathroom saying please do not change the towels. And they did not.So thank you!Just reminder. If you actually care about our planet and resources and trying to decrease our footprint, do it, not just say that!

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,10,"I paid for our room at the Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown through a 3rd party. Upon check in I was asked for a debit card to hold for deposit and would be refunded upon check out. While checking out I asked and was told my debit card has not and will not be charge for anything except for daily parking (which was fine). I also asked the debit card to be closed and if anything not to be charged or used. Was told the card was closed, not only by the person at the front desk, but also told by the valet person (after paying for parking wanted to make sure card was closed). 3 days after check out my debit card was charged $479.00. I right away contacted the Hotel and was transferred to accounting where I was told it was my problem and I had to prove it was paid through a 3rd party and that's what happens sometimes by using a 3rd party to get discounted nights. I have been emailing and calling for weeks for the Hotel to refund my account. Not to mention there was not form of contact regarding the issue and I specifically asked for that card to be closed and not used for any reason. They could have contacted me and if I had owed any monies I could have at least used another form of payment. THEY ILLEGALLY AND UNLAWFULLY CHARGED MY ACCOUNT! VERY VERY UPSET AND WILL GO SOCIAL MEDIA REGARDING THIE MATTER.","Dear Danifree,Thank you for your stay with us and for sharing your experience with other travelers. First of all, I am sorry to hear about your concerns in regards to your final bill.I have ran a quick investigation to find out the reasons that led to this error. As per our records, we have contacted HotelPlanner on your behalf and they have confirmed that your reservation was not prepaid and HotelPlanner did not process any payment for your stay therefore the charge is valid. The credit card provided at time of booking was only charged for first night deposit per your Hotelplanner confirmation. Our Finance team reached out to you to explain the detailed charges and asked if you can provide proof that your card was double charged. As per our records, we are still awaiting for the screenshot of your credit card statement showing that you paid through third party. Once proof is provided, Finance will be happy to refund the $479.00.I appreciate that we cannot get it right all of the time but when we make a mistake, we rectify it right away. I would be happy to discuss your concerns regarding this matter, please feel free to contact me directly at Christine.co1@ihg.com. I look forward to speaking with you so I can provide you a satisfactory solution.Thank you again for your time and look forward to hearing from you.Yours sincerely,Christine",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: September 2018,"Response from ChristineC5865, Manager at Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown","Responded Oct 28, 2018"

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"Hotel Indigo LA Downtown is fairly new and has some clever design touches, but overall I found it disappointing and would not recommend it given the many choices in the area. Service was slow and not particularly friendly.Room: The standard room was smallish, average size for a downtown hotel--nicely designed but certainly nothing special. Higher floor rooms facing northwest would have nice views, all other rooms just face nearby buildings. The room was rather noisy, with some street noise and surprisingly even noise from the room above.Amenities: The pool is okay but very small, with no spa. The fitness center was good. The top-floor lounge had nice views while the lobby was small and congested. Annoyingly, an event closed the outdoor patio and most of the pool the entire time I was there-- no notice or consideration given to guests. I think that happens often at this hotel.Service: Below average. When I checked in the front desk agent initially claimed I could only get a low-floor, disabled access room--unless I paid an upgrade fee. (Of course, when I refused this, another room magically became available.) I wasn't offered any choice of room location or view, even when I inquired. In general staff was unfriendly, never greeting guests. Used room service dishes remained in the hallway the entire time I was there.Location: Convenient to most of downtown LA but the immediate surroundings are dreary--it's a 10 minute, somewhat isolated walk to LA Live/Staples Center or the heart of downtown.","Dear TravelDan2014,I would like to thank you for taking the time to share your experience at Hotel Indigo.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,20,"I reserved my booking through booking.com where I paid for lodging and breakfast for 3. Upon checkin I was told that the reservation only included breakfast for 2 despite my confirmation and proof of booking. The host at guest services continued by telling me that nothing could be done about it, so I contacted booking.com and they assured me that the matter would be resolved. This is not the way I envisioned the start of my vacation. So, as we made our way to our room upon inspection we noticed the room was not cleaned at all. The floors were dirty with stains and dried substances but the worst of it was a used bandaid hanging from the air conditioning unit. I went back down to the front desk where I was promptly placed in a different room. All this happen within the first few hours of my stay made for a very exhausting and frustrating experience; not to mention being in my third trimester of pregnancy. To Booking.com's credit the matter involving the breakfast passes was taken care of and honored. The next day, however, I noticed that I was being overcharged for my stay. I went back to the front desk with a copy of my reservation, after making me wait several minutes before acknowledging me, Shai, the desk attendant finally offered her assistance. She gave me a hand written explanation of the charges, even after I requested a formal print out of all charges. How is that acceptable? I again had to spend a considerable part of my vacation trying to right wrongs that were not my own. I again called booking.com and they assured my that the matter would be handled which is was but this caused me a lot of undue stress and hassle only for them to take $40 off the my bill. I would not recommend this place to any one else. Horrible and unwarranted experience!!! I will say that the rest of the service staff were excellent and pleasant. My advice is to think twice about booking here or not at all! I read the reviews before my stay and was impressed so it's hard not to think I was given the worst intentionally!","Dear Christy,Thank you for your stay with us and for sharing your experience with other travelers. I am sorry to hear of the problems you experienced during your recent stay at our hotel. Please rest assured that we have addressed your concerns with our team and with Booking.com to find out how we fell short and to ensure that we improve on this.As explained by our Front desk staff your credit card was not overcharged. The authorization happened at check-in when your card was first swiped and our system automatically authorizes for possible incidental charges.It’s the cost of the room, including tax, plus a set incidental hold of $100 per day. That basically establishes a line of credit for typical items that you might charge to the room, such as room service, restaurant or bar charges or Valet parking fees.The incidental hold are temporary authorizations and not an actual charge.I appreciate that we cannot get it right all of the time but when we make a mistake, we really try to rectify it during the guests stay, to ensure that our guest leave us feeling happy and relaxed.We are committed to providing our guests with the highest quality services and facilities.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,10,"Pretty disappointing hotel which I can't recommend to anyone. The staff here is generally poor-mannered and not at the level of service one would expect for a hotel charging $250+ per night. The experience with the staff was disappointing from start to finish- pulled up at around 11PM to check-in and no one came to help with luggage, offer assistance, or bother to open the door even though there were plenty of people standing around- our room was noisy and the staff was initially unhelpful and unwilling to move us to a quieter location. quite rude as well- no service either as I was leaving and carrying my luggage. Had to open my own door which makes me sound like a diva, but if you have 3 people standing around and you see me with both hands occupied, do your job and offer me some hospitality.The worst part is actually the room itself which looks amazing but seems to be poorly constructed. I don't think I've ever stayed in a hotel where there was more random rattling and popping noises coming from the wall. If you like sleeping quietly through the night, this hotel is not for you. The AC is horrible as well. They brag about the low dB level for the unit, but unfortunately 1) it's not very efficient at heating/cooling and 2) it's poorly mounted so while the AC is quiet, you can hear the vibrations from the mounts. Again you need to choose whether you want to be at a comfortable temperature or be constantly disturbed by vibrations.","Dear Mr. Wong,Thank you for choosing Hotel Indigo and for taking the time to provide feedback about your experience.I would like to start by apologizing to you for the inconveniences you faced during your stay.We strive to make each stay as pleasant and comfortable as possible, and we appreciate that you brought your experience to our attention.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"I really wanted to give this a hotel a 4 or 5 rating because the staff is very friendly, the rooms are very nice, and the location is good, but here's why i couldnt bring myself to do so: When i first checked in, i was given a room overlooking the outside pool area with music thumping at 4:00 pm on a rainy 60 degree day with not a person in sight. The music was so loud that i immediately asked for a different room.The rooms all have special air conditioner units that are very high-tech and new, but complicated to operate via the remote control you're given. I couldnt tell if the a/c was supposed to be constantly on, but it was. I even went on the internet to try and find an owners manual, to no avail.Lastly, there is no coffee maker in the room, which i found very odd. Additionally, there is no coffee in the lobby. The only place to get coffee is at the bar or the restaurant. I asked the bar tender for a coffee as i was checking out that morning. He gave me the coffee and then I walked away. He signaled me back to ""pay the check."" It was $3.00 plus dollars for a tiny cup of coffee. I was quite impressed that the hotel has the gal to charge guests $3 for what should otherwise be free coffee in a $250 per night hotel.","Greetings MLEEUNDERWOOD,Thank you for your review!

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,10,"I was initially very excited for my stay at the Hotel Indigo. I had read nothing but good reviews, the location looked good, and the hotel itself looked beautiful. I would like to warn potential guests that there is something being ignored here. Once we checked in and got into our room, a member of our group took a very unpleasant shower. The shower head setting were irrelevant because the holes were so clogged up that it functioned only as a jet. We informed the hotel staff and they went to change the head while we were out for lunch. We had no idea the permanent jet setting was a blessing in disguise. For the rest of our stay we had water pressure equal to a light rain. The temperature regulator in the shower was also broken. The water was either ice cold or hot enough to burn your skin. The staff does not seem to have mastered communication. Our room only had 2 water glasses and we had four guests in the room. The cleaning staff never took our dirty glasses to replace them each day. We, on multiple occasions, called guest services to ask for more glasses. Each occasion required a minimum of three calls to the desk and often a walk down there to finally get someone to bring us glasses. I was truly astonished at the amount of time we had to wait for such a simple request. My biggest issue is with the valet situation. It costs $42 + tax to valet your car there overnight. Something I find unreasonable to begin with. They valet staff and hotel staff failed to inform us at any point that we would be charged this fee automatically. Upon check out, I was given the invoice, showing we had racked up a $346 valet charge over he course of our 7 night stay. When we expressed our disappointment to the hotel and valet staff, they didn’t seem to care at all. They just said “okay” in response to anything until we walked away. Then, no one helped us load our suitcases into the vehicle or assisted us in any way as we got ready to leave.","Greetings thesarahbella,I am very sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your stay with us.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,20,"The location of this hotel is great, 2 minutes walk from the staples centre and close to the metro and for shopping.The rooms are decorated nicely and have a retro feel to them with nice detailing throughout. Ice machine on each floor is good and there is good facilities in the room (fridge, hairdryer, safe, coffee machine). There is also a nice pool area with loungers and a bar.Unfortunately the service at this hotel is a long way off which is a shame as this ruined the experience. On check in was left waiting and when the guy dealt with us he left half way through and started dealing with another couple - very unprofessional. Nothing was pointed out at check in just seemed keen to take credit card details. Be careful with the deposit they take from you , they overcharged my card and I had to question it and nobody seemed to know what was happening they also pluck amounts from nowhere - first told it was $300, then $500 nobody seems to know what is happening here.Staff also don't seem to acknowledge you when you leave/enter which would add a nice touch.At breakfast the service again was very slow with 1 waiter serving everybody and 1 doing the coffee/tea.Improvements in the service are definitely needed as the hotel is nice but this side of things let it down big time unfortunately for the high price I paid I would of expected a much better level of service and this hotel needs to do better to get return custom.","Hello ultimatesi,Thank you for taking the time to write a review of our hotel.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,20,"My family of 3 members stayed here for a week, the hotel is nice and very convenient to go to all locations. But the service was poor,Room Service: We have 3 people and all they gave us was just 2 sets of everything, when we call and ask them to give one more set they have missed it for two times and when they finally remember it they gave me almost 20 hair conditioner, shampoo and body wash, very unprofessional and trying to short me.Secondary, the room service will never tidy up our iron, slippers and towels, iron with the wire all spread out, they didn’t tidy it up for us, slippers was same location and everywhere on the floor, and towels was messy. One time I thought the room was not done yet but I didn’t ask eventually.Front Desk: when I checkout I found that they have charged me 7 days of valet parking which I have only used on the first day, and I told the front desk guy he was rude and keep shaking his leg and ask me to go outside and talk to the valet counter myself, I was very pissed off that he didn’t ask and need me to ask by myself. Eventually I managed to ask him to take care of it but end up he calculated the wrong parking fee again, and the 3rd time they finally calculate it right. I advice you guys to check your bill when you checkout.Valet Parking: They were just standing there and see my whole family moving the luggage by ourselves and didn’t offer any help, I never seen this kind of bad service before.Overall experience it was good in terms of the environment and structure. But the service was the worst I ever have for all hotels I have ever lived. Those staffs need to train better and more professional. It’s not a cheap hotel anyway, customers should not deserve these attitude.","Greetings Gabriel L,Thank you for your review.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"The reviews did not match up for this DTLA property. With a location next to the freeway off-ramp you will venture away from this destination for food and fun. There is construction across the street and the lobby is small and just meh. The hallways are dark and gloomy like being in the Disney Tower of Terror. The room is clean and somewhat trendy. The bed is comfy, but the pillows are horrible and the bath towels are super small and therefore deemed useless. Bath products are dolled out in small quantities and there are no cotton balls or q-tips. One saving grace is the view!

As they were well aware of, these are very valuable pieces of jewelry both in value and sentiment. It is interesting and very suspicious that the biggest most expensive ring is the one that wasnt returned to me.There is only one conclusion, my contact Pushpa, and or their staff have stolen one piece and chosen to return the rest in the hope that nothing further would be done.Stay away if you value your things!","Greetings Lee M,We certainly appreciate you taking the time to bring this matter to our attention and apologize for any inconvenience you may have experienced.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,20,"My husband and I stayed here one night with another couple when we were going to a concert at Microsoft Theater. From the moment we walked through the door, I was disappointed purely from a customer service standpoint. The hotel itself was beautiful, but it’s all downhill from there. The women’s bathroom in the lobby smelled horrible - like something had died there. I used that bathroom three different times and it was the same each time on two different days.When we entered the hotel, there were three people at the front desk and no one acknowledged our friends to even make eye contact or welcome them to the hotel. We went to the bar for drinks, and even though the bartender was very nice, he forgot our drinks until we reminded him - and that happened twice. We were 4 of only 6 in the bar at the time. At breakfast the next morning, we stood at the hostess desk for 5 or more minutes before anyone appeared. We were seated and I asked for coffee and water, but I got coffee and juice. I ordered off the menu rather than getting the buffet and it took over 30 minutes to get bacon and eggs and that only happened after we went back to the kitchen because none of the waiters came by to even check on us. Again, we were 4 of less than a dozen people there. Our friends came downstairs after us, and one of them ordered a side of fruit. Same thing happened and she was then charged for a buffet which she didn’t eat. Customer service training and management is desperately needed. Nice people, but poorly trained, poorly supervised and in need of immediate management if this place is going to survive.","Greetings TauniaR,Thank you for your review!

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,20,"Recently opened property in downtown Los Angeles’ new Metropolis development. The physical property here is simply stunning; easily the nicest of many Indigo properties I've visited – this could very well be the flagship property for the Indigo brand. Unfortunately, service and IHG recognition was remarkably weak. If they can improve on their service I wouldn't hesitate to return, but I'll be watching other reviews in the meantime. At the current time, I cannot recommend the Indigo Los Angeles Downtown.Pros:- Brand new property with beautifully designed rooms and inviting common spaces. Fantastic Jonathan Adler bathroom amenities. Thoughtful design throughout - I really appreciate how the bed's headboards each have 2 power outlets and a USB outlet. Large bathrooms and huge showers. Beautiful pool deck and cabanas.- Great location in downtown – close to the Staples Center and L.A. Live ComplexCons:- Poor check-in experience. Lengthy wait. Pretentious check-in agent. Reserved room type not available. Reserved a king room (specifically, per my confirmation, a ""king standard non-smoking""). At 3pm check-in, was told no king room was available, was advised to check back later and given a double room on the lowest possible floor. Before leaving for dinner, still no king was available. Even when I got back to the hotel at 11:30pm, was still told nothing was available (despite ihg.com showing 9 different king room types still available - and all king categories showing at least 3+ rooms available!). Even more frustrating, while at the check-in desk the couple next to me was assigned a king room! I was told any confirmed room type was ""simply a preference and not a guarantee.""- Terrible IHG participation. Absolutely no recognition as IHG Spire Ambassador member. Actually had to politely remind the check-in desk following check-in to receive the welcome amenity. Was told they ""weren't aware"" I was a Spire level member (despite it clearly being printed on the check-in form I signed). Lengthy (10+ minute) check-in process. No room upgrade (not even to a slightly higher floor). Welcome amenity not proactively provided. Late checkout not granted beyond 12pm - not even 30 minutes (despite 2pm checkout being a published IHG benefit). Welcome drink certificate clearly states it includes a “signature drink” but bartender initially insisted any of the signature drinks listed on the menu were not eligible using the welcome drink certificate.- Not all venues open – I was greatly looking forward to checking out 18 Social – the hotel’s rooftop bar which is clearly advertised throughout the hotel's webpage and in the room. Apparently, though, 18 Social hadn't opened yet during my visit in late June (no mention of this anywhere). At a minimum, the property should have noted which venues were not yet opened instead of advertising everything as being open and available (as is very common, in my experience, when staying at new hotels where not all facilities are yet open)Someone needs to remind this hotel they're an IHG property, or remove them entirely from the Indigo brand.","Greetings BrandrB,Thank you for your feedback! We thank you for being in IHG Rewards Member! It's Spire members like yourself that truly knows service. We apologize for the experience you had!

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,10,"LOUD MUSIC EVERYWHERE!! This was not good music, but blaring techno music and it was everywhere. It was in the lobby, the bar, the gym, the restaurant one could not escape. Even when I was working out, I had my own earbuds on and still could hear the music. I complained the entire two weeks, did no good. I was told that someone named Kevin said he knew how to open a restaurant/bar and loud music was it. Everyone complained, you could not carry on a conversation, therefore people talked louder and louder. Too bad. I complained to the front desk, they did not seem to care. Then on top of the horrible music was the extrememly strong smell of marijuana coming into my room for two days. Contacted the front desk and they sent someone up and said yes it is marijuana and it is coming from somewhere. Now it was not coming from outside, I was on the 16th floor! My sister and I both had headaches for two days. Rules against smoking were posted, guess people did not think that applied to marijuana. It was that way for two days! HEADACHES! Great Bed and linens!With the exception of Alfred at the front desk, who by the way was great, the other staff memebers at the front desk were not at all professional or nice. This is a beautiful new hotel, and certain individuals were great, but. Only someone under 30 should ever stay there. No shower caps, no q-tips, things that one expects in a hotel. The room was beautiful and housekeepers were great. Louis, Jasmine and Chris were great and Alfred was I think the only adult, they were great things about this hotel. All were friendly and yet professional. The hotel needs to get hire more employees like Alfred, Louis, Jasmine and Chris.","Greetings Collector,Thank you for your review!

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"First walk in, the lobby is on the smaller side for a Downtown LA hotel but was very unique and clean. From the shelves filled with an assortment of hats and what seemed to be a chandelier made from bike spokes, the decor was reminiscent of what you'd see in a Madonna-esque music video. Similar decor in the rooms coupled with the cleanliness gave the room a crisp feeling; especially with the awesome over-sized bathrooms. One thing to note was that in our room was a picture...of the back of a woman looking into a compact mirror with the eyes looking at you. This picture was posted on the glass between the shower and the toilet so that she's looking at you when you're most exposed.Operations of the hotel were okay as some elements were lacking but other positions were functioning great.Valet - Attendants don't approach you so you must park, grab keys, exit vehicle, wait for them to finish conversing and let them know you want to valet your car. Retrieving the car? Same thing.Front Desk - While I don't run the hotel, it was troubling to see only one front desk agent...in a downtown hotel...next to LA Live...during a soldout convention. Both the morning and evening associates were very friendly though.Bar 1st floor- A little bit slower on the service side but prices were at what was expected for the area.Housekeeping - Everywhere we went in the hotel, the cleanliness was on point. Even when asking for amenities such as pillows, blankets, and toothbrushes they were very quick.Last bit to note was the shower. Very large but didn't come with shampoo/conditioner/lotion. In addition, the water pressure was very poor. It got to a point where if you held the wand at an angle of 30 degrees or more the water would just trickle down your arm instead of spraying forward.It's a newer hotel so hopefully it'll learn from these growing pains but at ~$380/night, I'd wait for a slower season to visit this hotel.","Greetings GatewayDestination,Thank you for your review!

I know they are new, but it is unacceptable to overbook and then bump me to a hotel so far away when I reserved well in advance.","Greetings Virginafoodie,Thank you for you review!

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"Check-in was a nightmare--36 minutes in a very long line to move to the front of the line and get our key. One other reviewer said the same thing. Even if everyone descends at the same time, hotel professionals should know how to handle such situations. Large wedding parties, anyone? Conventions and conferences? The staff was very friendly, apologetic, and responsive but as tired travelers, this is not a good first impression. Decor does not signal Hollywood and LA, unless you mean Paris Hilton and Kim Kardashian. A cinematic vibe could be had in a more tasteful yet energetic manner. Same holds true for the room decor--a mishmash going nowhere in theme. The bathroom is beautiful though, with interesting floor tile, marble, and photographic overlay on glass/acrylic. No wastepaper basket in main bedroom area--only a teeny-tiny one in the bathroom. And, very poor planning for the electric coffee maker--when we tried to slide it out on its drawer, the extension chord doesn't reach far enough to use it. The curtain in the corner window--where you would get the nicest view, doesn't open all the way. Still, I will give them some time to improve the decor, kinks in amenities, and front desk service. The employees are great!","Greetings Carmelites,Thank you for your review! Your Feedback is important to us as we gear up for the busy summer head. We apologize you had to wait 36 minutes for check in as we do our best to check in our guests as soon as we can, but certainly some afternoons have a larger volume, especially on weekends.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"Pros---Hotel is new, so things are relatively nice: firm beds, non carpeted floor, nice enough bathroom.-Nice that there is a pool, though it was pretty cold despite the blazing hot sun.Cons:- Service was SO bad, from start to finish. We arrived to a long line for check in, and multiple people seemingly working behind the front desk, but only two of whom were actually checking people in. We had asked for a crib when booking, and it was not there upon arrival. We called down to the front desk because the A/C unit was not working properly. They promised to send someone up; no one ever came. We called down to the front desk the next morning to ask housekeeping to bring an additional shampoo/conditioner. Again, they promised to send someone; no one ever came. We asked for late check out as we had a flight to catch out of LAX later and wanted to minimize waiting at the airport with two small kids. They made us feel that we were getting a huge favor by letting us stay 1.5 hours after check out on a Sunday. Then, get this: They made it so that our keycards for the room expired so that, for the last 1.5 hours of our stay, we could not freely go in and out of our room.-The wall decorations are SUPER cheesy. Think Planet Hollywood.-You can hear EVERY sound. We could hear vacuuming in the room above us around 10 p.m., water going through the building pipes all through the night, and other people coming and going all through the night. Not a good night's sleep at all.","Greetings Reinhardtk,Thank you for your review! Your feed back is important to us and appreciate your notes on our current service. We do apologize for the longer check in process last Saturday due to a city wide sell out as majority of our guests all arrived at the same time due to a big event at the Rose Bowl. We are working on faster delivery time and will follow up with each guest regarding any request. Please note our keys automatically expire at noon, which is our standard check out time, and when you request for a later check out, we would need to reactivate your keys to allow longer access to your room. Our interior designer, Hirsch Bedner, has certainly delivered a beautiful product that tells our neighbor story: Downtown Los Angeles in the Golden Era of Hollywood.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,10,"I spent six nights at this new property, which as a HI tries to be trendy (e.g., black wall in the guest rooms). I tried to move after the second day, but nearby hotels were booked. I definitely would not stay at this property again.Where do I begin? First safety. The hotel is located across the street from the Salvation Army. Homeless people hang-out and sleep across the street. I would never let my wife or daughters walk from this hotel to or from the convention center alone.One evening, the fire alarm rang. I ran out of my room and raced down the six flights of steps. In the lobby, I was told that it was a false alarm “which sometimes happens”. I have stayed hundreds of nights in hotels around the world, and this was only the second time that I heard a fire alarm (the first time was an actual fire). I couldn’t help think of my elderly year old mom at the hotel in this situation.The Indigo is not full service. There is not even a pretense of a concierge. Food options are limited. There is a tiny self-service snack bar in the lobby selling $4 small bottles of Coke.The room and bathroom were well sized, and the wi-fi worked fine. There was a mild unpleasant smell which one quickly gets used to, but always hits you when you walk into the room. I complained about this, and a few days latter the Front Desk Manager called to tell me that he confirmed that there is no smell. He needs extensive training.During the second day I needed to call the front desk THREE TIMES to have the room made up. The next day I needed to call ONLY ONCE, in the evening, to have the room made up. When I was told that no manager or assistant manager was present on the property, I emailed the hotel manager Raymond.vermolen@ihg.com and cc’ed top execs at IHG. Our housekeeping problem was quickly fixed.Half of the front desk staff were very helpful. The other half were usefulness: they could not answer routine questions such as where is the the ice machine on my floor?, can you please point to nearest metro stop for the train to Santa Monica?, can you please point to the closest supermarket?. I don’t trust such people with my safety.As I said above, I would not stay at this property again. There are many comparably priced alternatives.","Greetings Soccer D,Thank you for your review.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"As others have stated, we all paid full price for services that did not exist as advertised on the indigo website. Cagey and just unprofessional. The hotel is on the cusp of a learning curve in all of its departments. They opened too soon before they fixed the bugs and started booking guests so we get receive the experience of learning of the bad lighting, cold water, curtains that wouldn't open, strangers knocking at your door at odd times, etc.I would be staying at any of the other competitors, but thought, ""Indigo might be fun with my friends and we can check the latest new spot in Downtown.Sorry, but I cannot send them to Indigo.Management hasn't prepared staff for Primetime. And discerning travelers.Don't know when they will be, either. They lack that love; that passion for their jobs.There were little things, like lights that didn't work, my room key that kept having to bere-keyed, cold room service, no salt and pepper, water. My sea bass was less the size of a small deck of cards with 3, count 'em, 3 haricot verts, and 2 fingerling potatoes. It was quite a tiny plate, with butter brought up but no bread. $38. Yikes.There are 2 elevators on each floor and I mistakenly took the freight elevator, as there was no signage indicating otherwise. I get in a padded, crappy elevator-oh well- it is going to get me to the lobby floor--so I took it. Just another example of lack of management minding their p's and q's ensuring the guests have a superlative experience.I travel to Downtown LA all the time and just cannot recommend this hotel.Nice façade. The rest of the hotel was a let down. All for $395 for my convention rate.I have a handful of excellent hotels that I would choose over this one. Perhaps give the Indigo another year to get their act together-and properly train their staff.","Greetings Elaine197,Thank you for your review.

Hotel Indigo Los Angeles Downtown,30,"I booked a room for a quiet weekend for myself alongside the LA Festival of Books on their website for a 'superior room'.When I checked in, the clerk noted that there were no available king-sized rooms, so I was booked in a two queen room. Just an expensive, albeit pretty, regular hotel room, with some packing peanuts still present on the furniture. When I called to ask the front desk about the superior room addition, they told me they'd send someone up, so I sat and read for an hour -- nobody came. When I went down for dinner later, the staff at the desk apologized again that they were overbooked/couldn't get me a King-sized bed and offered me a 15% coupon for the restaurant.The next day, when I checked out, I again asked about what the 'superior room' difference was supposed to be, and the staff just looked confused about it. I checked the website again this morning to note that the Superior Room (with 20 additional dollar fee) is still being offered. If anybody decides to book this room type, I'd suggest calling the hotel first to figure out if they have figured out what it means. If it is the 15% off coupon for dinner, it isn't worth it unless you are spending nearly 150 dollars on the meal.As another reviewer mentioned, the top floor bar 18 Social is not finished, a note that is definitely missing on the website. I had hoped to catch a drink there and look at the LA skyline, so this was definitely disappointing. My time at the ground level bar and restaurant was weirdly plagued by flies -- so much so that I requested to move to another area, but it didn't help. There was also something wrong with their beer tap, and my beer ended up maybe two thirds full of beer with a very generous topping off foam. The food is tiny portions, but tasty -- the flies seriously ruined it for me though.Overall, I think the hotel is still finding it's feet, and if I had known I wasn't going to get the room I booked nor a chance to see much of the evening LA skyline, I'd have stayed elsewhere. It may be worth staying once all the King sized rooms are done and the 18 Social bar is open, but otherwise it seems overpriced for the location and offerings.","Dear Stephanie B,Thank you for staying with here with us in Downtown LA.

The first glass had white residue in the bottom so the previous guest had used it for their toothbrush and housekeeping simply flipped the glass over uncleaned! I then went down to the kitchen to grab new glasses and the wine glasses were sticky as they too had been returned to the cabinet uncleaned after someone had used them for wine. From the rooms you hear everyone in the hallway, every toilet flush in the hotel and every faucet squeak as someone turns if on. As we checked out , I asked my teenage daughter whose sock was by the bedside table and apparently it was not ours!

Palihouse Santa Monica,10,"Stay as far away from this hotel as possible!! I called to make a reservation with them for a room to occupy 2 persons. Their rooms come in queen and king size beds only. So the rooms are designed to occupy up 2 people. In this case we had 2 heterosexual males that wanted to share a room. They told us either they get 2 separate rooms or charge us $40 extra per night for a roll away bed!! Roll away beds are for when you bring an extra person to the room. That was not the case here at all. So essentially, the hotel rooms are designed for either couples or a single person. Its an inefficient policy that contradicts what every hotel does. But that's their business. However, what was most disappointing part of the experience was the rude person that was working their reservation line. He was extremely rude in a way that I have never experienced. He literally said over the telephone that they did not want our business, to go elsewhere, and ""to not waste their time."" Wow. I never in my life had a hotel operator go out of their way to be rude and to expressly insult me over the telephone. If that is what we can expect on a reservation telephone call, only imagine what the experience will be at the hotel itself. Very very unprofessional.

Let’s start with when he checked and was told there was only one key and not to lose it as the last guest didn’t return the key. A huge security concern! On our wedding night we arrived back to find there was no air. At 2am in the morning we called downstairs to find out that they were well aware the air was broken.

I am sorry to hear you did not have an enjoyable experience with us during your stay. We of course would never knowingly put someone in a room with broken A/C, unfortunately after you had checked in the A/C did go down and we were made aware of it around the same time as you were just a little before 5pm and immediately called for a technician to come out and the earliest they could come was the next morning. This does not excuse the fact that you had room with no A/C for the evening but as you mentioned in your review we did give you a 50% discount for the inconvenience. The A/C was repaired the next morning and we would certainly like to welcome you back to give us another try in the future.

Palihouse Santa Monica,10,"Right...this place is no doubt cute and unique for the area but please be aware it is not a hotel. It is a set of self catering apartments within a pleasant building (bar the elevator). They have no restaurant and no licence to sell alcohol. The one member of staff we saw treated us with respect but there are times when it feels like the Marie Celeste. The receptionist is tucked away in a dark corner of the foyer area and therefore not really visible to passing guests. Please be aware you will be charged for every little extra and if you think $4 for a t-bag is acceptable then go ahead and stay here! In fairness after challenging this obsence charge it was removed from the bill but what ""boutique hotel"" would even consider charging you for a t-bag? The items to purchase in the rooms are very expensive too. You also need to be aware that overnight valet parking is $50 per night - walk three blocks and you can find it for free. And the elevator .... if you want to feel you have stepped into an Alfred Hitchcock film then by all means take the lift - its not a pleasant experience as the door violently slams shut on you - needless to say we walked the 3 floors up! This ""lodge/hotel/apartment"" (whatever it is) is certainly not Value for Money - by far the most expensive place we stayed in a month in the US and by far the most dissapointing. What a shame - drop the price, improve the service, decide what you are offering (and be transparent about it - the web site is very vague) and you'd have a little gem on your hands.","Dear Alex K,Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica, it goes without saying we are highly disappointed your sentiments do not match our normal tones of all-encompassing excellence. As is evident by our ranking and all of our 5 star reviews, this experience is certainly out of the ordinary nor acceptable.To our prospective guests I would like to take this time to allude to some inaccuracies in your review. We do have a full restaurant in the hotel, serving breakfast, lunch and dinner along with room service. The valet is $45 per night and we are actually the least expensive as far as parking, compared to other hotels in the area. We also proudly do not charge an additional destination/facility fee, which every hotel in Santa Monica does on a nightly basis.The hotel is a registered historical building , that draws guests who appreciate its charm and uniqueness but we conversely realize we are not for everyone. We are proud to be a relaxing haven and escape from the cookie cutter hospitality norm.I hope on your next visit to Santa Monica, you are able to find a hotel more suitable to your tastes and budget.Best,Greg Shortt | Housemaster",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: June 2019,"Response from PaliManagement, Manager at Palihouse Santa Monica","Responded Jun 17, 2019"
Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"The building was interesting, the rooms were fine, and we liked the location as it was quiet and away from the crowded part of Santa Monica. The main problem was the hotel's attitude. This hotel is so unbelievably pleased with itself. There is no 'welcome' on arrival. There are no lingering staff or evidence of management to wish you Good Morning or ask how things are going. The reception desk is tucked away in a side cupboard. The young man on reception was very casually dressed, had an earring and stubble. We had booked two rooms for 3 nights at eye-watering last-minute prices and specifically told the front desk that we could only book the rooms if there would be a rollaway bed in order to accommodate one of my children. On check-in it was clear they had promised roll-aways to many families, and most of us were out of luck. There was no apology. I asked for the situation to be escalated and the boy at the desk told me we could have complimentary breakfast, but this did not resolve where smallest child was to sleep. We ended up pushing a chair from one room into the other one (while the bemused housekeepers looked on) to team it up with another one as a sort of mini bed. The complimentary breakfast was laughable. A charming waiter in training stumbled apologetically through an hour of incorrect orders, items delivered cold and not at the same time. A couple of positives: They offer (good) continental breakfast as complimentary on Saturdays and Sundays and they are missing a trick by not offering this throughout the week. However they need more than one staff on duty to replenish the breakfast bar. Also I very much appreciated having complimentary tea and coffee available in the room kitchens. In my view the hotel succeeds by default, possibly because it was the only hotel not fully booked in high summer due to its location away from the main drag. This hotel was heaving with successful European families who were clearly looking for somewhere interesting and slightly different to stay. By failing to provide the welcome and attention that is deserved at all good hotels, particularly with those charging a premium, the Pali House sends a negative vibe that travels internationally.","Dear TheaReade,Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica. I am sorry to read that your stay with us 8 months ago was not a pleasurable one and was surprised to read the main reason was the staff and service.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"This is a very stylish and sweet hotel, well located in a residential neighborhood but close to everything. Seeing the photos, I thought it looked perfect. Here are the issues that are important to be aware of.The air conditioning, which does exist, hardly makes a dent in the night heat. Our room had a distinct “old building” smell- it’s not ocean air as the hotel responds in reviews. There isn’t much to be done about this by the hotel- everything is very very clean. This was a deal breaker for me. As reviews have mentioned, no liquor license- not the hotels fault but they don’t make this incredibly apparent on their website. We had breakfast at the hotel one day and it was a terrible experience. Only one guy working, he was working hard, but coffee took 20 min to arrive once we sat down. The meal took a bit longer, and was decidedly mediocre and expensive. If you stay eat elsewhere. Hotel also charges for an extra toothbrush- really not cool for this price point. The in room coffee- we had a studio- consisted of only one pod of caffeinated and one of decaf, and no creamer of any sort. This felt stingy and inhospitable. I hope Palihouse can make some improvements- there is a lot to like but it just falls short.","Dear cupcakekitty,Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica.

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,"We stayed at the Pali House for 3 nights while visiting friends in Santa Monica. We paid around $400 for the room. The hotel lobby is beautiful and old, but our room was one of the worst rooms I’ve ever stayed in. The layout was very awkward and weird, the bathroom was tiny. The shower was small for even a very small person to use. The carpet was old and there were random holes in our wall. Extremely poor condition. Also, there was no coffee in the room, and the coffee shop didn’t open until 7am, which was frustrating for us east coasters up early in the morning. My husband is one of the least picky people I know and he went out of his way to say that he never wanted to stay at this hotel again.

Palihouse Santa Monica,10,"First of all, pro-tip...do NOT let them put you in Room 112.

The bathroom was so tiny it was actually difficult to maneuver in there - thankfully I didn’t need to shower during my one night stay.

Palihouse Santa Monica,10,"We were sold from the photos of old retro with touch of Parisien charm.As soon as we entering the room, my allergy kick in due to the old dirty indoor outdoor carpet and the starge smells in the room.","Dear Ching W,Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica, I am sorry to hear that you suffered from allergies while you were here, however I can assure that our wonderful indoor carpeting is new carpet (not old), and is thoroughly vacuumed daily and steam cleaned on a regular basis.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,It was a nice place to stay. Close to promadade 3rd street. Would of love to have breakfast at our hotel but they did not have that as an option. They did have room service type of deal but it was pretty expensive. Would I stay here again probably not. It was quite expensive and for that price for two nights I would stay somewhere else that can accommodate us with an option of a restaurant and a pool.,"Dear Joannemaxcy,Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica. I am happy to hear that you had a nice stay, however I am disappointed to hear about your concerns regarding the breakfast and restaurant options as we have a full restaurant in the hotel which serves breakfast and lunch in the lobby and both outside courtyards. We also offer Dinner service from 1212 restaurant in Santa Monica. Additionally we offer our hotel guests a free continental breakfast served in the lobby on Saturdays and Sundays, which our guests just love and of course room service, so we do have a lot of dining options.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"Location was brilliant, setback one street from the beach, perfect as the road in front of the beach is busy so buildings there I suspect get a lot of road noise. Palihouse is very close for walking to the Promenade for shopping. Hotel itself was lovely, great staff, great ambience, loved the decor and the amenities, the room was very spacious (we had a lounge with a sofa bed in it as well as a bedroom & little kitchen). The hotel seems to be a converted apartment building so each room is like a little apartment. Problem was that as it's an older building, it has creaky floors and thin sound insulation - we could hear the people in the room beside us talking (a lot!), could hear people walking past our door late at night, the people walking up and down the stairs with their luggage.... you get the picture. My husband simply couldn't sleep. If it wasn't for the noise issue would recommend highly but the minimum expectation of a hotel is to be able to sleep at night. Breakfast was 'ok', staff were lovely, parking seemed to be a bit of an issue as it's residential so their valet has limited spaces, it was fine for us as had a car for only one of the days and they gave us a parking permit - luckily we found a spot for the car nearby, not sure that's always going to work though. Overall it's nice and would stay again, if not for the noise issue. It's not what I would classify as a 'luxury' hotel though, it's definitely not the Mandarin Oriental or the Four Seasons, it's a boutique hotel with loads of character a great interior designer and a great location.","Dear Pigacho,Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica.

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,"This place got great reviews but you had better be ready for drama if you het the wring room.Where can I start? If you like Dracula films you'll love the design. If you want to sleep, forget about it.Visually it's dark and weird and creepy, which can be tons of fun. But (and this is a huge BUT) the room was a sauna and it has a giant radiator that was scorching hot to the touch. Even when you turned it off made no difference. It was so hot i went through 3 bottles of water. You het those cost $10.00 each.When someone flushed the toilet up above/next door, it sounded like a bomb went off. Every time. There's a sign that says ""the ocean air brings a musty smell so turn on the atomizer"", which didn't work. The musty smell had nothing to do with the OTHER smell, which was either backed up pipes or ghosts....who can tell?!?!? The room has a door that looked like a closet...that SURPRISE....led to another room. Is there a lock on your side? No. Is there one on their side? Sure! Do you feel safe in any way? No.When you arrive they'll give you a little note that says this is a historic building with idiosyncrasies. As soon as i read that I knew I was in for it and that this was my ""don't call the front desk to complain because the hotel is sold out"" message.Oh and the staff were friendly.","Dear Vee33 Mag,Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica, I am sorry to hear that you did not have the best experience with us here. I understand that you found the heating in the room to be too warm but a simple call to the front desk and we would have been more than happy to have taken care of this for you. We are working on installing brand new air conditioning and heating units so hopefully this will help if you decide to give us another try in the future. And yes we do have bottled water in the minibar for purchase but of course if any of our guests are experiencing an issue such as you had; we will certainly do everything possible to remedy the situation without an added expense. We do have a wonderful ocean breeze here in Santa Monica, and that can leave a scent that some adore and some may not, which is why we have the option of an atomizer in the room, I am sorry that yours did not seem to work but again a quick call to alert our helpful and friendly staff and we would replace that right away as we have plenty of extra on hand.We do have some adjoining rooms with connecting doors and those doors are locked at all times and can only be opened by a front desk agent with a key, no guest can ever open those doors, I understand your concern with this but I can assure you they are completely safe and secure.And I am glad you received our wonderful welcome note that lets guests know about some of the wonderful features and amenities that we provide here at Palihouse and as you mentioned we do have some idiosyncrasies, being a historical landmark building we feel as most of our guests do that it only adds to the charm, it in no way indicates that we are here to give anything less than the best service possible when a guest calls the desk for assistance. I am really sorry to hear that you did not reach out to us with these concerns during your stay and allowed us the opportunity to address these issues for you to assure you had a wonderful experience, that being said I hope I was able to address your concerns and I do hope you will consider giving us another try if decide to visit beautiful Santa Monica again.Best,Greg Shortt | Housemaster",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: January 2017,"Response from PalihouseManagement, General Manager at Palihouse Santa Monica","Responded Feb 22, 2017"
Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"Very dissapointing 3 night stay. Worst hotel in a 2 week trip down the California coast. Cleanliness and maintenance of our room was very poor. Before we unpacked we had to ask for the carpet to be cleaned of food and a very dirty valance to be changed on the bed (see photos) kettle and dirty chipped mugs in the room but no coffee or tea??? Asked reception to provide a coffee machine which they did however the mugs don't fit in the machine so had to ask for cups which did, it took one more call to reception and 3 more visits from various members of staff to sort the problem...only 2 coffees per allowed! ! No clock in the room room and the mirror was located in the wardrobe. The bath and tiles had been painted and the paint was peeling off See photos. ..we could go on and on..after raising issues with a mixed response we dicided to grin and bare it and move on.......message to Management. ..look at your rooms and maintain them..look at your cleaning standards and improve them and review your hospitality strategy...why this is not a 1 star review is that it is ideally located and is in a quiet area of town with lovely garden and reception area..This Hotel could be wonderful if only someone took an interest in the detail..see the good and the bad photos attached.","Dear Eric K,Thank you for taking the time in sharing you experience with us.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"We stayed here for three nights and despite all the hype I'd heard about Palihouse I actually think the hotel was over-rated. Sure the building is nice and the architecture impressive, the interiors are beautiful but for the price? Neither my partner or I was convinced. I really wanted to love this place but the lack of air conditioning on a hot night was a struggle for us and the fan provided was noisy so it was a restless sleep. When guests arrive late the clatter of their suitcases on the pebble stone path wakes you and oddly the concierge doesn't recognise the noise he's making at 1am and drags the suitcases through the courtyard without any consideration for the guests - I thought was a bit odd. Surely the hotel knows the noise is an issue so just carry the suitcases during the night. The hotel also has a kind of musky smell to it and maybe this is the sea but I just didn't get it.The bikes are available to hire but the tyres were flat, the seats dropped, the pedals scrape the chain guard with every rotation and they squeak... a service maybe? And no USB ports in the room, or charges available through concierge - could you provide a power board or something this is 2016 and I get its an old hotel but seriously USB adapters are like $5 - keep a few at the front desk.","Dear Ben M,We are sorry to hear your stay with us did not meet expectations. Whilst the property does not have air conditioning, all of our rooms have several large operable windows, which usually allow for the wonderful Santa Monica cool ocean breeze to circulate. We also have ceiling fans in most rooms and portable fans in all of the closets. We are really sorry to hear this did not suffice during your stay with us. We are also sorry to hear about the disruption at 1am. We are addressing this with the overnight agents to make sure both the staff and hotel guests are not dragging suitcases at this time of the night as this should certainly not be the case and we let you down with this unnecessary disruption. The bikes should also not have any issues and are serviced ongoing, so we are addressing this.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"Palihouse is a boutique style hotel. The room I had was a suite with a kitchen and small table. It overlooked the street and was nice.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"I really didn't know what to expect so this is, in my opinion, the pros and cons.Pros: Its a historic building and very interesting. The bed was comfortable and I slept well. I was not there on a weekend so the breakfast was not complementary but very good and I enjoyed it on their very nice garden patio.Cons: I arrived on a Monday night at about 9:00 pm and their ""lot was full"" so I had to obtain a (free) parking permit to park my brand new Lexus on the street where there is very little parking available. Second night, same scenario. I found out their lot is very small and most guests have to park on the street. BE FOREWARNED. Since it is a very old building, it has that old, sort of musty smell. The bathroom and shower were very tiny.This hotel is less expensive than the more elegant hotels by the beach but there are sacrifices.","Dear BigBearMom1,Thank you for taking the time in sharing your thoughts with us! We are glad you enjoyed our comfortable beds, so we’re happy you were able to get a good night’s sleep. Although our complimentary breakfast is only available over the weekend, I'm sure you would agree that our a la carte breakfast is pretty delicious! Given that we’re a historic building located in a residential area, we offer more than one option for parking to accommodate all of our guests. During the time prior to Palihouse, the Embassy Hotel only provided parking passes, and when we upgraded the hotel, we added the valet to be an additional amenity for our guests. It is on a first come first serve basis, so unfortunately when our lot is full we only have the complimentary parking passes to offer to our guests. There is also a secure parking lot less than 2 mins walk from the hotel. Regarding the 'musty' smell, this is usually attributable to the ocean air on some of the warmer summer days. All of our rooms have operable windows and as the classic rooms are smaller we have recently added diffusers to these rooms.We hope you consider us again in the near future!Cheers!Dan Arana | Assistant Housemaster",Trip type: Traveled solo,Date of stay: August 2016,"Response from PalihouseManagement, Front Office Manager at Palihouse Santa Monica","Responded Aug 14, 2016"

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,"VERY disappointed in this property, this was NOT a 4 star, as it was listed.This is a lodge-type of hotel in a nice residential neighborhood, in fact, it could have been a converted home.The ""elevator"" was unacceptable, very outdated, my bathroom walls and hardware shook (I thought I was next to the elevator but in fact I was no where near the elevator), NO AC in the room, the smell was damp and musty, the bathroom sink drain backed up, when it filled you'd have to wait 4 minutes for the water to drain before you can continue washing, the toilet handle had to be held down for nearly a minute so there would be enough water to flush, there is no restaurant, the very very limited ""room service"" menu is basically a few items that front desk can order from a restaurant 2 blocks away, then they'd run to retrieve the food and bring up to your room. No one is posted at Front Desk until 7am, if you call prior, you'll only get a voicemail.The accommodations are basically small apartments with full kitchens, I can see that being of use to leisure travelers, but not for business travelers who need hotel services and a good night's sleep.The staff was kind.","Dear Cathy R,We are sorry to hear the hotel was not up to your standards, but do understand that Palihouse Santa Monica is not for everyone.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"Given what else is on offer in the area this is not quite right for the price point. For a recently acquired property it really needs some work:- lifts are tired and make a very loud noise when opening and closing, you do not want a room near them- bathroom had enamel missing in many parts on the bath tub- tiles had blown around the bath tub- another lazy, blowy shower curtain that will not stay in place- avocado toilet seat? staying in the 1970s is not cool- sink cold tap runs at a trickle- a queen size bed is not big enough at this rate- no air con- tatty furniture, not shabby-chic, just tatty- public carpets look dirtyAll in all it needs money spending on it to bring it up to scratch and a serious lick of paint and gutting of the bathrooms would help.Close to 3rd St in Santa Monica so you can park your car (for $36) and then walk around to enjoy the local area.","Dear ChrisAlner,We apologize our interior design did not bode well for you, but we understand that this hotel is not for everyone.

Exactly what I don't want to do on a holiday!!A few suggestions; get the lift fixed, get a liquor license, properly enamel the bathrooms as they are grim, recarpet the mustard stinky carpet and install some a/c.

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,The room was adequate. The bathroom tile had grout that was worn and greying. The bath drain was rusted. The closet light didn't work. TV was good as was the Internet connection.I was awakened at 4AM by a guest banging on the front door because he was locked out of the hotel. He banged loud enough and with enough force to break the front door. There was no attempt made by the hotel management to apologize or compensate me other than offering me a free cup of coffee when I complained. Too little too late. I will not return.Ed Rosenberg,"Dear Edwin R.I apologize for the maintenance issues in your guestroom and the noise created by one of our guests.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"My wife and I and a friend stayed at the Embassy Apartments at least 8 or 9 times before it changed to the more trendy, upscale and artifical Palihouse. We stayed 8 days and had planned to stay longer, but checked out. Money for the room had to be sent well in advance of our reservation, with no cancellation or return policy. We found the price of the room excessive; newer furnishings, comfortable beds, and excellent staff who worked hard to make our visit pleasant. Elevator broke down; noises from carpet being installed throughout hotel; toilet didn't work, so our room had to be changed; items in basket in kitchen were highly expensive; high cost to have someone do shopping; food could be ordered in from a nearby excellent restaurant; and the ""rainwater"" shower was most minimal. A lot of hype and glitz, but little substance. Why are all books throughout the hotel facing outward?? (Titles can't be read) New style furniture, but not comfortable. After writing to management, the e-mail response was their hotel isn't for everyone. We will never go there again and will not recommend it to those we know. Sorry, it was a lot finer when it was the Embassy Apartments. It's lost its charm and warmth.","Dear Joemoose,I am sorry that you didn’t find Palihouse to your liking.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"This used to be the moderately priced Embassy hotel, but now it's been fixed up and priced up.Our king room was attractive, and so are the grounds and lobby area. However, there was not a single drawer or accessible shelf to put things in/on in either our room or bathroom. To be fair, there was a closet with some hangers, but otherwise living out of a suitcase was mandatory. The scant furnishings were chosen by a designer for looks only with not a thought to practicality. Think art in the form of a framed piece of glass saying ""HOTEL"" in large gold letters, and a glum portrait of an unknown person on an easel (we turned it to face the wall).The elevator is manual and opening and closing the heavy doors is difficult. There is no bar, and no food or drink available before 7 am, so if you want coffee before leaving for the airport, forget it (we also did not have a coffee maker in our room, and there would not have been anywhere to put it). If you arrange something for the next day with a staff member in the evening, don't expect the morning staff to know about it, although in fairness everyone was pleasant.The room service coffee was served in paper cups. The cold water pipes in the shower rattled. I won't go on, suffice it to say that this hotel is expensive, and attractive in its way, but lacks simple amenities.","Dear Billie61,Thank you taking the time to provide us feedback on your experience. As you pointed out, there are idiosyncrasies which come with the age of the building as I’m sure you can understand and with that said, our staff is always on hand to accommodate you with any needs you may need during your stay. While our restaurant hours are limited, our Palifornia app is a great resource for providing you with any restaurant needs during your stay.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"First time travelling alone, and first time in the United States.Had heard good things and loved the pictures of the hotel. the Hotel grounds were exactly as you see. It is picture perfect.After a long 14 hour flight, all I wanted to do was check into my room, but apparently the room I had booked was the ""only room"" it was and I totally understand, it was a Veterans Day when I arrived so the hotel was full. Normally they said if the room was ready they would let me check in earlier. I wish they gave me the option to check into another room nd pay the difference. They did advise the check out was at 11am, so I came back to the room at 12, but it still wasnt ready. It was disheartening to see other groups check in to there rooms, but I kept getting told my room was being priortised to clean - but clearly wasnt if new groups were able to check in earlier then myself...Location - a very easy walk to the pier, and to Third Street Promenade... Did this walk a few times due to the Check In. But got all the shopping out of the way.I also had some issues with the Front Desk (taxi for early morning flight wasnt ordered, but lucky I was up early enough and they got me another, so made my flight with no problems to, then my card which was preauth would have taken a month to come back had I not questioned the hotel) - but in saying that, I had no other problems.Due to its location and the sheer beauty I would most likely still stay here again.I did receive follow up emails from management afterwards regarding my stay so there Customer Service Follow Up is better.","Hello bubygyrl2015,Thank you so much for your review! I’m happy to hear that we lived up to your aesthetic expectations. I want to apologize for the miscommunication with the front desk. Since we were full that weekend, it’s possible they didn’t offer another room for an additional charge as we may have not had anything else available. It’s typically pretty standard to offer a different room category if the arriving guest’s room is not available at the time for the price difference. I will be sure to address this with my team to ensure they are offering the alternative if this is not the case. As for other guests checking in after you, it’s also possible that the room types those guests may have booked were vacated early enough to be completely clean before your arrival. I also want to apologize for the other issues you experienced with the front desk, I’m happy to hear you were able to find a cab in time to the airport. I’m happy to see that none of the issues you mentioned would deter you from staying with us again, as we would love to welcome you back.

Palihouse Santa Monica,10,"The Palihouse certainly is an interesting hotel and the grand front entrance and lobby/dinning area make for a dramatic experience.We arrived early but our luggage was checked for us and after a long brunch with exceptional coffee and service our room was ready. Unfortunately this is where our great experience ended.We believed our travel agent booked us a suite with a kitchenette, which we were really looking forward to as it was the last stop after several weeks travelling through the US, but we were given a classic room - obviously not the hotels fault. What compounded this is the fact that the hotel does not have a bar nor a dinner menu. In saying that there is a small selection of meals that can be ordered from a restaurant close by however during our stay the restaurant was closed to the public due to private functions on several of the nights. Fernando was our saviour one evening and picked up some take out for us.The room itself had stained threadbare carpet which desperately needs replacing. The bathroom was a nightmare!! It was so small I'm sure it must be in breach of building codes. To get to the toilet or the wash basin one had to open the door, take one step into the room (an extremely small step) then manoeuvre nearly into the shower stall to the left, then close the door to be able to get to these facilities. If someone accidentally opened the door while you were standing at the wash basin you would be knocked out.For the price there was nothing in the way of items such as water however they did provided 2 bottles in the room for purchase at $10 each! There was also a basket of goods such as popcorn, chocolate etc but no price list. We were mistaken in thinking this may have been included in our room rate. Also we were only given one black tea bag (although the there was about 4 green tea bags) & when my husband went down stairs one morning to ask for 2 tea bags & a small jug of milk he had to wait a considerable time, no problem there, but the staff member informed him that only because he waited he wouldn't charge us! We can only hope that was a joke but judging by other similar comments we don't think it was.Unfortunate during our stay we had an urgent issue that had to be resolved by phone, we were completely flabbergasted to find they did not have the provision for an international phone call.We were quite disappointed with the Palihouse as we really thought it was going to be an upmarket hotel experience from yesteryear but what we received was a very mediocre bed & breakfast without the breakfast included.","Dear KandBMoo,I apologize sincerely for the several issues you seemed to have experienced here with us at Palihouse Santa Monica, I assure you that this is not how the team is constructed to operate as you will see from our many other glowing five star reviews. Our minibar price-lists are typically in every suite, however it appears we missed the mark on having it noticeable in your room. I also apologize for the challenges you faced with some of our staff members and I assure you that these issues are taken seriously and will be addressed with the appropriate team members. We take the utmost pride in our property maintenance so were surprised to hear about the carpet in your guest room and will be looking into this ASAP. There are very few rooms in the hotel with the set-up of the bathroom that you mentioned and I can certainly understand your concerns, however as the building is a historic 1927 building, it does come with some idiosyncrasies like smaller bathrooms in some of the classic rooms. Our phones do not have international call capabilities; however if you didn’t have a cell phone with international calling capabilities our staff should have provided you with an alternative that was convenient. I would like to welcome you and your husband back to stay with us as i really think we can change your mind the second time around. Please reach out to me directly (Marcus@palihousesm.com) as I would like to discuss these challenges further and gladly make your next booking for you to ensure you will get into one of our fabulous Grand Studio Residences!

Palihouse Santa Monica,10,"My wife and I decided on the Palihouse after reading reviews and seeing the website. Looked cool and retro funky. We were just in LA for two days at the start of a weeks vacation and this looked like a great place to start. For some reason, I was under the impression its near the beach. I've stayed in LA and Santa Monica many times and figured it was time for a change. What a mistake.We pulled up to the Palihouse around 9:00 PM. Its not near the beach, its about five blocks from the beach, in a residential neighborhood. The entrance was unlit, I figured a light had gone out. There was no sign, well maybe they want to keep a low profile? The conspicuous absence of a valet seemed odd, but maybe the valet was parking another guests car? So we park illegally in a space reserved for valets. We begin to unload all of our luggage, there's no one to help us and its dark, so we trudge inside with all our bags, leaving our car with the hazards on hoping we won't get ticketed or towed.When we finally enter the hotel, the first thing my wife says is ""This place smells like bathroom cleaner and mold"" She's right. The ""lobby"" which is just a big room with some old furniture in it, reminds me of an apartment building or old hospital waiting room. Its stone and smelly and dank. There's a guy at a ""bar"" (which can't be a bar because they don't serve alcohol) who meekly greets us and points toward ""reception"".We find the ""front desk"", its a tiny little room up some stairs and around the corner form the lobby. We are greeted by a friendly young woman in very casual dress, I ask about the valet, she says they don't have one and ""the lots full, but you can park on the street or in the 3rd street garage."" the third street garage could have been in Nevada, as I am not local and not familiar with the area, thus the need for a hotel. She hands me a map and a parking pass, I drive around for 45 minutes looking for parking. Finally I decide its time to see the room before I sacrifice too much more of my vacation time looking for parking, so I park illegally and run up to the room.When I get into the room four things dawn on me. It reeks of mold, there's no air conditioning, this place hasn't been updated since 1960 and its clearly time to leave. . One look at wife alerts me that she is an a full blown allergy attack, she allergic to mold.We get all of our luggage and head down stairs, I apologize to the woman at the front desk and say its just not for us. Hoping to leave without talking about the gross misrepresentation on their website, the mold and the lack of amenities. There's no bar, no room service, no restaurant, no valet, no bellhop, no air conditioning, no automatic elevator doors and so on. She informs me that they'll have to charge me for my stay. I inform her about the mold and the smell. She says, ""Don't worry, we won't charge you There's no reason to get upset"". She then talks to the manager, who didn't even have the common courtesy to talk to me face to face, and he decides that we should be charged the full amount for the room. I guess his reasoning is that its our fault that my wife can't tolerate high levels of mold.THE WORST PLACE EVER.","Dear Taj M,Thank you for your review. It appears you experienced several issues during your brief encounter with us. I want to apologize for the lack of service and for the condition of the room that you mentioned.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"I rarely review with such a resounding negative slam, but this deserves it for the price they charge and the pretension they express. Because of its location we had stayed there 3 times when it was the run down Embassy hotel. We didn't expect much and we didn't get much but it had a certain shabby chicness. The new higher price is undeserved and the redecoration runs between Pottery Barn and Thrift shop.Here are the deserved complaints: no place to put two small pieces of luggage except on the the two small chairs leaving only the bed to sit on. The one table was loaded with things to sell like baseball caps, scented candle ($65), all together I counted 23 items for sale which I put in a pile on the table so I could use the table as a cramped desk when I removed the luggage from the chair. Was I in a store or a hotel? In the closet behind 2 heavy winter terry cloth robes was a $150 tote bag for sale, all of which blocked the only full length mirror in the place. Those robes were not for a California climate. The only other mirror was in the bathroom which was too small for two people to share and too high on the wall for most women. There were two tea bags on the hot water service tray and each day I had to ask the desk for two more. There was never coffee.How can this be a Boutique hotel at $355 a day? It has no class.On the positive side the bed and linens were good and the desk people and other service people were very nice. When our breakfast card on the door knob, placed before midnight, had not been taken when we expected it to be served in the morning, we called the clerk who produced it in about 3 minutes full of apologies. Evidently it had never been given to him. The two french doors opened onto a small balcony providing ventilation for the room, probably the only air one gets in the summer because I didn't see an air condition unit. Beware if you are there in a hot month. I only saw the inside of the room we were in.There may be much nicer ones considering the praise in some reviews or perhaps I am too demanding, but I expect places to justify their prices.We have had to stay in some bad hotels because of circumstances or a bad choice on my part, but this is the first time I've been mislead by reviews.Will we stay there again. NO, there is a hotel down the street more commodious and with less ""charm"" (the thrift store objects) for $211.It is lamentable that such a nice building, formerly the Embassy, has substituted tacky for charm and lacks many of the conveniences that qualify as Boutique.","Dear Sue B,Thank you for your recent stay at Palihouse Santa Monica, and thank you for your review. We are all disappointed that we didn’t meet and exceed your expectations. While we do not claim to be for everyone, we appreciate you trying us out and would always welcome you back. If you do decide to return and stay with us, there are a number of things that I would like to share with you, so that you might be able to enjoy your stay with us.Regarding a place to put your luggage, we do have luggage racks for your use. In order to not clutter the rooms with them, they are not placed in the rooms, but a member of our staff would gladly bring one to your room upon request.We do have a number of things for sale in our rooms, I assure you that we are not offended if you choose not to purchase anything. I can also assure you that while these items for sale are very nice, they are not necessary; merely an offering of some items that we really enjoy. In fact, the tote bag that you found in the closet can be used by our guests during their stay in the hotel without purchasing anything. With regards to desk space, we can always provide you with a larger work area if you would like. Again, please just notify the front desk if you require anything including, but not limited to, additional tea bags, coffee, coffee makers or even a larger mirror.I was surprised to hear that your overnight room service order was not picked up from your door. Upon addressing it with the café staff, they asked me to remind you for your next stay to hang your door hanger on the outside door knob of your room, rather than within the room.While it sounds like we were not the hotel for you, I would love to welcome you back for a return visit. Please let us know if you will be returning, so we can hopefully prepare a much more enjoyable visit for you.

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,"I don't know how this has 5 star reviews, I really don't. While the building itself is chic and well rehabbed, the service is very sub par. This is not a functional hotel and lugging a toddler into it was a nightmare.Parking - there is no parking, only valet - per LA style. However, the valet guys addressed us very rudely, are very slow and if you get back after they close you have to park at least 4 blocks away and pay for it yourself and move it by 8am - so much for sleeping in.Towels - our room had no towels. We looked up and down in every built in, nothing. So we called down to requet some and they made us feel as if we were lying. How about sorry? So we said we needed 3 sets for the 3 people in our room, they brought us 2 bath towels and the poor cleaning lady did not understand us when we asked for more.Room Service - Speaking of cleaning.... we went out around 10 and came back at 4 and our room had not been cleaned, we napped and started to get ready for dinner and at 5 they knocked for room service. My husband tried to explain that it was too late and they just keep saying sorry.There is no bell guy to help with bags, you're lucky if you can snag a valet guy, but then who is running valet. The elevator fits one person and maybe a one small luggage bag, a stroller is a hard fit. So good luck with the flights of stairs. It's just not a functional space, albeit cute.Oh and there are NO coffee makers in the rooms. You can request one, but it will take an hour or so and by then you can walk down the street.","Dear AmandaW,Thank you for sharing your feedback on Trip Advisor. We are disappointed to hear we’ve let you down, and would like a moment to address your concerns openly.Parking: We understand the arrival and departure experience is vital to setting the tone for your stay, and leaving a lasting impression. We are sorry to hear our Valet staff came across as impolite and we’ve addressed this with them. Please expect a follow up from our Valet Manager directly with an apology. We also appreciate your concern regarding accessibility of parking. We’d like to clarify that Valet is available from 7am to 11pm. To retrieve your car after hours, just dial 0, and the front desk agent will assist you. Street parking is not required, but also an alternative option should you choose.Towels: We provide the finest linen and terry at Palihouse Santa Monica. Each room is dressed with ample bath towels, face cloths, and hand towels. We are sorry to learn there was a staff miscommunication during your stay resulting in your request for this basic amenity. We appreciate you advising us of the situation, and have addressed this with our staff in great detail. Rest assured, it is not the norm, and it is not acceptable even once.Room Service (Housekeeping): Palihouse provides daily housekeeping for all guests between the hours of 3pm and 5pm daily. In efforts to accommodate all guests, we do take requests for specific times of day, however, we cannot guarantee them. We are sorry the late day cleaning inconvenienced you, and we will do our best to provide clearer communication at time of check in moving forward.Bellman: You are correct, we do not have a traditional bellman. However, our team is highly cross trained and eager to assist guests with bags, or, any need they may have to ensure we exceed your expectations. We apologize we did not make you comfortable, and will continue to coach our team on how to be proactive so guests can relax and unwind.Coffee Makers: We apologize it took longer than you expected to receive your coffee maker. We encourage guests to notify us at the time of service if they are experiencing any complication so we can address it promptly with our Housemaster.We understand Palihouse may not be the right fit for everyone, yet, service excellence is our top priority. We thank you for telling us about your experience so we may continue to improve. Should you choose to return, we would love the opportunity to wow you.

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,"Since I began typing this review (and after my wife had posted her review on Yelp the night of our stay), , Palihouse has changed their description on both Hotels.com and Tripadvisor - removing wording such as ""Beachfront"" - which was a lie. They're also describing themselves as a ""Lodge"" not a hotel. While this stay was for a personal trip, I stay in hotels for a living with work, and I'm getting tired of these ""hipster"" hotels that are nothing but lipstick on a pig. They're designed to look good on instagram posts, but are not at all functional - designed by interior decorators, not architects, and this is where the issues arise. They're oh so cleaver in hiding the fact that their property doesn't have basic amenities and services you come to expect with a premium fee hotel.A quick list of items you should be aware of:* There is no air conditioning in the building, and the ceiling fan in our room didn't work.* No bar - that's right folks NO BAR in this boutique hotel errrr ummmmm I mean Lodge.* Elevator - or moving closet. It's small.... very small... and up a half flight of stairs, and there's no bellman to help you get in - so don't have too much luggage.* There are no outlets by the bed... Come on already decorators! At least buy some extension cords from Conway Electric!* Vacuuming at 9pm - that's what's going on outside our room right now. This is a first - and a new all time low.* What other reviewers have stated about the sound issues? All true. Walls are paper thin.* Bottled water is $10. That's right - a new all time high.How do I fall for these crappy places? Must be those pesky bloggers/Instagramers/Twitter folks I follow. I'm assuming they're comp'd rooms so they'll blast it out to the world - and it works. I'm here. My credit card was charged a lot of money, and I sit with no drink in my hand, sweating in my room, after driving all day to get here. As I was a sucker and fell hook line and sinker, I'm here to make sure other people won't get sucked in as well. Run people! Run!To the Fairmont Santa Monica folks - I'm very sorry I strayed from your fantastic service and amenities. Never again!","Dear Brian B,Thank you for your recent stay with us, and thank you for your review.

If you find the temperature of your room to be uncomfortable, please notify the front desk as we can always assist with any needs.I would also like to mention, while we do not have a bar, guests are more than welcome to bring in any beverages that they would like to enjoy in our hotel.All rooms are equipped with extension cords that can be utilized while lying in bed. I am sorry that you were not able to find yours, but like anything that you would like during your stay with us, we ask that you just contact the front desk so that we can assist with all of your needs.Regarding the price of bottled water, we appreciate your feedback and we will definitely look into our pricing of all of our minibar products. It is important for us to offer these products at a fair price. If you find the price to be high, please note that we do have complimentary small bottles of water at the front desk for guest consumption.Finally, I would just like to mention that all bloggers, instagrammers, twitter folks and anyone else that would like to experience our hotel, and share their experience, pay full price for their rooms. We do not comp rooms to these guests. Nor do we encourage these guests to write reviews.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"What a beautiful, charming, cozy hotel — with *lots* of small problems. I'm sure this place will be fantastic in a year or two, but for now it isn't for everyone. When we stayed for a quiet weekend in January just after New Years, the hotel was woefully understaffed and under-managed. It took two hours after checkin to get towels or wifi password. (we kept calling, but nobody was at the front desk, so eventually we emailed their main info line.) The toilet was ridiculously cramped in the back of our bathroom (not at all like the photos or floorplan we saw on the website). The shower (a very vintage mid-century tub with plastic curtain) wouldn't drain, and was filled with other people's hair. Management blamed this on vintage plumbing(!) but yikes, even for a motel that's unacceptable. My 7am lobby breakfast was lovely, but the single employee sounded completely overwhelmed by 3 tables of people (though to be fair, it seems she was servicing room service orders too). Our last straw came because a lot of the rooms appear to share doors/closets with other rooms. From 3am-5am we could hear every single peep from our neighbors — who were simply talking and getting ready — but it completely kept us awake.We checked out early to try and salvage our weekend. Maybe we'll try again in a year or two, but only if it were half the price. Just too much.","Dear Adam D,Thank you for your recent stay with us.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"We read about Palihouse in Conde Nest Traveller and just had to come and check it out on our LA trip. The Palihouse has the eclectic curated charm that is familiar to Soho House properties. The building itself is spectacular and graceful - you feel instantly like you are being transported back in time.The communal areas are where the real design highlights are with gorgeous original wrought iron windows and wonderfully sourced furnishings which will make you want to stay a while and linger with a laptop or newspaper. The garden areas also look amazing for warm weather relaxing.We stayed in a 2 bed apartment with our 3 kids. The rooms were huge and the tasteful design carried through albeit in a slightly more sparse fashion. The bathrooms and kitchen are charming, simple and old school. Overall however the room was gloomy and dark - frankly a little depressing. Great for sleeping, but not pleasant for living.The staff are hit and miss. Some are enthusiastic and engaging. Others seem sleepy and bored. You could forgive them perhaps as the overall static atmosphere of the place may send a sane person over the edge.Having stayed at 7 hotels in 3 weeks around LA and Palm Springs, unfortunately the Palihouse Santa Monica experience just didn't stack up as being special enough for the $1k+ per night price tag.PROS:- Nice big living spaces in a gorgeous period building- Design lovers will be inspired by the furnishings- Excellent location just a few blocks from 3rd street and the beach- Good for familiesCONS:- Overpriced for the relatively slim service, experience and on-site amenities.- Parking, even with a valet (who are great) is a bit of a hassle.- Poorly stocked kitchen. One saucepan, no tea towel, peeler, coffee maker only on request.","Dear Nick D,Thank you for your recent stay with us, and thank you for your review.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"I would rate this hotel a 3.5. It is like a beach lodge turned upside down. At first, the gentleman who checked me in was very gracious and welcoming. I thought I was going to love the place. He was by far, the nicest of the employees. Some were pleasant but no other real standouts. One of the valets had a bit of an attitude, which grew tiresome after 3 days.The upgraded room was spacious and uniquely designed. The bed was comfortable.Some of the design in the room was interesting. The antlers on the rack above the bed, seemed like a disaster waiting to happen, as they were not bolted down.I did like the hotel and the location. I felt the room was a bit overpriced. Several times I would call to the Front Desk and no answer.I would probably try another hotel on my next visit.","Dear BulldogMatt,Thank you for your recent stay with us at Palihouse Santa Monica, and thank you for your review. While I am pleased to hear that you enjoyed some aspects of the hotel, I must apologize for the areas that we fell short of your expectations.It is definitely concerning to us that some members of our staff were not able to provide the level of service that we expect. It is a vital aspect of our hotel, and something that we take very seriously. It will definitely be addressed and corrected immediately.I understand that it is your intention to stay elsewhere on your next visit to Santa Monica, but we genuinely hope that you would give us another chance to impress you.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"First the pros :It looks great. Nice period building with original features.The staff were friendly and helpful.The location is great - in a quiet neighbourhood but within easy walking distance of 3rd street, the beach / pier.The room was a reasonable size, nice bed - comfy.The cons :It was hot when we visited and there is no aircon only a room fan which just doesn't do the job.There are no facilities here to speak of eg pool, bar (there is a bar area but was never open).Breakfast looked expensive ( and there was a great place we used down the end of 3rd street which was reasonably priced and always busy which is a good sign.)The parking - 30 odd dollars / day for valet parking - however - if you ask they can give you a permit to park on the street each day - we did so and always found a space despite it looking busy.Overall I think its a nice enough place but it is a bit pricey for what you get - hence it only gets an average from me.","Dear pete2216,Thank you for your recent star with us and thank you for your review.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"Stayed for one night only. First impressions not good, we had no help with luggage. Valet Parking expensive, beware if staying long term. The rooms we had was sufficient and well equipped in the kitchen and bathroom. The word eclectic about the Hotel springs to mind. The room was large and very dark, it was over-looked by apartments opposite; we were situated at the rear of the Hotel. If you require coffee making equipment you need to ask the front desk, why, who knows, couldn't be bothered to ask? The weather was very hot, no AC in our 2 rooms, they did have a useless fan though.","Dear mariox1us,Thank you for your recent stay at Palihouse Santa Monica, and thank you for your review. I am sorry to hear that you didn’t enjoy your stay with us.

We also provide fans in all of our rooms. In addition, feel free to ask the front desk for additional fans for your room. We are always willing and able to provide you with anything to make your stay with us as comfortable and pleasing as possible.Every guest that arrives to our hotel should be immediately greeted and offered assistance with their luggage from our valet staff. I will definitely be reviewing that with our staff, and I am sorry if that did not happen for you.Regarding valet services, the price of our valet is comparable, if not less than other hotels in the area. Unfortunately in a city like Los Angeles, parking is a premium and is offered at an additional charge. I am sorry that you found this to be concerning, but I assure you that the cost is at a Santa Monica hotel standard and at the appropriate price level.Nevertheless, we are very pleased that you chose to stay with us.

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,"We just spent 3 nights in Palihouse Santa Monica. Unfortunately we are not satisfied at all.The positive things:The room and athmosphere was really good.The negative things:Day 1In the room they have information about bikes. ""Please reserve bikes in advance to make sure you get them the day after"".I walked down to the front desk, wanted to do this. The guy said that there is no need. Bikes will be avaliable tomorrow.Next day, we walk down to get the bikes. The same guy says there are no bikes.. They are all rented out.It takes him about an hour to fix two bikes for us. One hour of waiting that we had not expected.Bike charge: 25 USD per bikeDay 2We used their valet parking during our stay. In the evening we needed the car to go to a restaurant. The valet parking guy said that he was going to be there until 11 pm. We ended our visit at the restaurant a little bit early to make sure to be back before he left. We arrived 1040 pm. No valet parking guy.Valet parking: 36 USD per nightDay 31030 am we asked the front desk for beach towels. The response was that the beach towels right now are in the washing machine. Instead of offering us two towels (any towels) he asks us to go back to our room and get it.Day 4Checking out we delivered the above feedback verbally to the guy in the front desk (same guy that we talked to Day 1 and 3 above). His response was, he could compensate me and my husband with 2 coffees to go...Other:The nightly rate do not include taxes. This is added.They do not have permission to serve alcohol and do not have a restaurant that is open after 3 pm. Something we expected when you pay over 450 USD per night, include valet parking and taxes.To summarize:If you need a clean and beautiful room to stay in, on a great location. This is a good hotel.If you expect basic good service and do not want to pay extra for everything else, this is not the place for you. Everything here is expensive.To Palihouse Santa Monica:I have now read the feedback you have been given here on Tripadvisor. To the people that gave you negative feedback your response were:""We do not claim to be for everyone""On several places.Because of this and because of your poor service in offering us just a coffee as a compensation when giving you above feedback verbally, when just having spent 1400 USD on your hotel, do not bother to respond to this review. You have already made sure that we will never recommend your place to anyone and that you do not care about your guests nor wanting to improve your service./AnnaStockholm, Sweden","Dear annasthlmswe,Thank you for your recent stay, and for sharing your feedback. We understand you don’t want us to respond, however, we feel a sincere apology is necessary. We are disappointed your stay did not go well, and we are so sorry for your experience. We would like to address your concerns to demonstrate we are dedicated to service excellence:1. Bicycle Rentals: You are absolutely right regarding the bicycle rental. We should have had your bikes reserved in advance, fully functioning, and ready for you to pick up! We certainly failed you in this area, and we have coached our staff on this subject so we are better prepared moving forward. We are pleased to hear you did get a chance to ride them, albeit after waiting for a while. Once again, our apologies for the inconvenience.2. Valet Parking: We spoke at length with our valet staff about the severity of not being available for you when you returned with your car. Our valet owner is reaching out to you personally to apologize. He has also recently promoted a valued and experienced employee to the Supervisor position, in order to provide the best service possible going forward.3. Beach Towels: We apologize that our front desk staff asked you to retrieve your own towels from your room! This is certainly not the level of service we are trained to provide our guests, and we have spoken at length to this employee about our company protocol going forward. We are dedicated to making sure we tend to even the most simple guest requests with ease.4. Taxes: You are correct. Our nightly room rates do not include taxes. This is specified on our website as well as third party partners, and is fairly common in the hotel industry.In summary, we sincerely apologize that we missed the mark in exceeding your expectations. We are committed to delivering the very best and assure you that is the norm. Cleary, our team underestimated the severity of your inconvenience and we would like to extend a discount on future stay, to further prove to you what the true Palihouse experience is all about. If you would like to discuss further, please contact myself personally via email (nadeev@palihousesm.com).Thank you again for sharing your feedback, and allowing us an opportunity to improve our performance.

Palihouse Santa Monica,10,"I booked this hotel having high hopes and expectations for what should have been a special stay... Clearly when you arrive here you are charmed by the stunning beauty of the building and the interior decor - it is beautiful - but having spent four nights here you begin to note that all is not as good as it should/could be. The rooms whist nicely finished are very noisy, our neighbours every morning banging and crashing around as the walls are very thin. We did have a morning where there was no running water, due to a fault with the water system, I get that these things happen but it could have been handled better. The team here lack the engagement with the guests that you would expect in this standard of hotel, the layout in the entrance doesn't help as the reception staff are hiding away around the corner or in a little Coffee bar but it goes deeper than this, it just lacks personality and warmth - it could be so good! The entrance/lounge is a stunning space however it never gets used as there is no encouragement to dwell or lounge - not helped by the lack of a bar. Prices and services here at unreasonable considering the price you have paid for the room, nothing is complementary everything is chargeable which is disappointing which leave you feeling somewhat short changed. To put this review into context, we had one night in the Palihouse West Hollywood before we came here, it was a completely different experience, warm and engaging colleagues, atmosphere and personality, a proper restaurant not just snacks - in hindsight we should have stayed there for our entire LA stop. This was our forth hotel on our 2 week trip to the west coast, it should have been the best, but is was the worst - a great hotel isn't just about nice lamps or beautiful interiors, it is experience and service and being treated as a guest - you remember this way longer than a light fitting","Dear Puma123x,Thank you for your recent stay at Palihouse Santa Monica.

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,"I have based my review on value for money which this hotel does not meet the expectation that the cost sets.We stayed for a week in a suite which was very spacious with an eclectic mix of furniture, the lounge was huge but contained little furniture. Kitchen had enough utensils to make some lunch but the appliances especially the kettle were a nightmare! The kettle was one you heated on the job which took forever but also didn't whistle when it was done so was easily forgotten about also once boiled the handle was too hot to actually pick up. There were no complimentary tea or coffee facilities, everything was charged for. The bathroom was tiny and because of the age of the hotel it never felt completely clean although the rainfall shower was very powerful (one of the best things about the room). Bed was very comfortable, nice comfy pillows too and great tv in both the bedroom and lounge. The bedroom had a 'wet dog like' smell the duration of our stay and you could hear the music from the lobby in the evening (late evening, when we were in bed) also could hear the other guests flushing toilets, rolling suitcases and people/traffic outside. The crib they provided for our daughter was a tacky travel cot.We ran out of tissues during our stay (our daughter had a cold) and they were never replaced, only a tiny thing but when your paying a lot of money to stay here then you would hope they would top up your supply daily.Location is great and felt very safe, they charge $39 to valet your car which we refused to pay, we found a street a few blocks away that you could park on for free.Overall the service offered did not meet my expectations for the price you pay, I get the feeling they don't feel like they have to offer a great service and they think the hotel itself is nice enough to warrant the price you pay-it's not!!","Dear gillyf15,Thank you for your recent stay with us at Palihouse Santa Monica.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"My expectations are proportional to the price; if it were not as expensive it would have gotten more stars. I thought it was fairly average for a hotel room that was ~$350/night. There are positives and negatives to most hotels, and this is no exception. We were here for three nights during the LA Marathon, and, overall, had a pleasant stay.Positives (in my opinion):- Fantastic location. If you're planning on staying in Santa Monica, you won't need a car, and it's a $1 ride on the 3/3 rapid bus to/from LAX- The one bedroom suite was a nice size, spacious for two people, and had huge windows- Employees were helpful- Asked for a coffee maker and along with it came delicious, freshly-ground coffee- Bed sheets and linens were very niceNegatives:- The elevator is old. It requires you to open a heavy door and slide open another gate. It was difficult to do with luggage. I imagine they would help you with it, but it would be a pain to call for help every time if you can't handle stairs- There are animal heads/horns ALL over, like an old hunting lodge. Antlers were even over our bed (negative for me, maybe not for you)- Thin walls. You will be able to hear other people- The dressing area and closets did smell a bit musty- The shower head was in the middle of the tub, which made for a slightly awkward shower- As another reviewer pointed out, there was only one frying pan and one pot in the kitchen. There was no pan for the oven and nothing non-stick. No drying towel, either. I'm sure I could have brought a 'request list' to the front desk, but, c'mon, who wants to ask for a million and one things just to be able to use a kitchen?- The room is cleaned bi-weekly; anything more frequent is $20- There is no designated area to dispose of the room's trash, but the kitchen only has a very small trashcan. Since the room isn't cleaned daily, I ended up taking our trash to the front desk... kinda awkward- There is a shelf over the sink in the bathroom. The position of this shelf made it impossible to wash one's face without splashing water all over the floor and/or hitting one's head on the shelf","Dear ef002104,Thank you for recent review of our hotel.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"Great reception by the cool car valet who took our bags to the front desk where our check in was easy. Since our room was not ready, me and Priscilla had some really good coffees in the beautiful lobby served by the barrista / food guy close to the fireplace. We really liked the decor throughout the hotel and thought it was really cool in a retro sort of way. Really nice design touches in the room and the bed was super comfortable with nice soft sheets and cushy pillows. We liked having a little kitchenette where we could eat our breakfast. We had checked out the website before we came so we knew what to expect about the look, location and feel of this place, so no surprises there. But... We ordered breakfast and everything was cold. On our second night, we couldn't figure out why we were so hot and why our throats were parched. In the morning we realized that the rads were going full tilt and it wasn't even cold outside.

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,"NOT WORTH IT. Stay somewhere else if you want a solid night of sleep and expect to get to get your money's worth.Nice staff and charming ambiance but overpriced and overhyped. Paper thin walls, no alcohol license, communal heating, and musty smelling. This hotel is not on par with other luxury hotels it is similarly priced too.I was very excited to surprise my wife with a relaxing weekend getaway and this hotel seemed ideal given our style and taste. However, the initial charm of the hotel quickly wore off within the first few minutes of entering our room. Although the room was spacious and well designed, it smelled old and musty and immediately put us both off. While I realize the hotel was built in the 20's- the smell was enough that we contemplated buying our own air freshener or candle.The room was also cold when we arrived and so we naturally went to turn the heat on. We looked everywhere but couldn't find the thermostat. We called the front desk and they informed us the hotel only has a furnace that turns on at a specific time at night to a temperature they feel is right, so they offered a small space heater instead (which at least they had). It was very annoying to say the least to not be in control of your own room temperature and at the mercy of what the hotel deems appropriate.The smell and the heating situation wasnt quite a deal breaker however, the old construction of the hotel was. By far the worst part of our stay was dealing the paper thin walls and noisey pipes that would wake us up at 6:30 every morning. Do not plan on sleeping-in here, especially if your upstairs neighbors happen to be early risers with kids. We heard every footstep and conversation as if they were in our room. If the guests upstairs wouldn't have woken us up, being situated next to the stairwell definitely did as we heard every single footstep walking down them and then past our room through the hallway.On the last morning of our stay, we were already trying to ignore the loud footsteps at 6:30 again when what sounded like the noise a tortured whale might make permeated our room for 30 minutes. It was either our upstairs neighbors running the water or something to do with the heating. Either way it was unbearable at that time of morning. My wife and I made tissue ear plugs but even that didn't help. We called the front desk both mornings to complain and they were apologetic but it didn't really help either matter.To top things off, the hotel is completely dry, as in does not have even have an alcohol liscence. We were told they were in the process of getting one but the hotel has been open for 8 months and still doesn't have one. Why?? I can't think of any other hotel in Palihouse's price range that does not serve alcohol.The location is pretty nice as it's a few blocks away from 3rd St. Promenade but don't expect any ocean views or quick beach access. There's also no pool/spa.Overall, I think the hotel has some positive attributes but it falls short in some of the most important ones and does not come close to justifying it's $400-800+ per night room rate. We wanted to love the place but it fell so far below our expectations that we would never recommend it.","Dear Bluesuedeshoe,Thank you for your review, and thank you for choosing to stay with us at Palihouse Santa Monica. I’m sorry to hear that your stay with us did not meet your expectations. While we strive to provide an exceptional service to all of our guests, we understand that the uniqueness and intricacies of our property are not for everyone. Allow me to take a moment to address some of your concerns.I am unfamiliar with the “musty” smell in your room. This is the first we have heard of this. I will definitely look into it and see if there is an issue. I would also like to recommend for your next stay to try lighting one of our signature Le Labo candles that are in all of our rooms. They offer a special, unique smell that everyone enjoys.Regarding our heating system, all of our rooms are equipped with steam radiators. When the hotels boiler is turned on, guests are able to adjust the heat in their rooms by simply turning their radiator on and off. As we are in Santa Monica, we often times do not need to turn on the boiler as we are in such a warm climate. In those instances where guests require their room to be warmer and the boiler is not turned on, we offer small electric heaters. I am glad to hear that we were at least able to provide that for you.I am sorry to hear that your neighbors kept you up. It is always something that we try and be aware of during our frequent property walks. During your next stay, if for any reason there is an issue with your room or your neighbors, please notify us so that we can assist you in finding an alternative room that might suit your needs.And finally, as for our liquor license, we do hope to have one soon. We would love nothing more than to offer our guests a glass of wine in our lobby.We do not claim to be a hotel for everyone, but those guests that we are attracting seem to really appreciate what we have here. I am sorry that you did not find that to be the case. Nonetheless, we appreciate your business and hope that you will stay with us again.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"As cool as they try to be, it's a hotel squeezed into an old building in a residential neighborhood. When I arrived, the valet parking was full, so I had to come inside and for a $200 hold on my credit card they gave me a parking pass so I could circle the block seven times to find parking. They gave me a very upgraded room, which I really appreciate...although it made me concerned for what a non-upgraded room was like. It appears that they invested a lot to have hip, new furnishings, but they still have single pane windows which provide no soundproofing, no AC so it was stuffy at night, and the smallest bathroom and strangest tub/shower situation I have ever seen. Overall, I just didn't find this to be a convenient and comfortable place to stay.","Dear Minibarmuncher,Thank you for your review. I apologize that you had so many challenges with valet parking. Please note that we are continuing to improve that service daily. While we are pleased to hear that we were able to offer you an upgrade, we are sorry to hear that you didn’t find your accommodations to be acceptable.

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,"If you ever wanted to stay in a hostel in Antwerp but didn't have the time, then try the Palihouse in Santa Monica. An old-gray mare of a building that is musty, dusty and downright rusty. The interior design offers some character -- clever on occasion but, rare occasions. (Although, I turned over the oil painting of the teenager portrait; I just had to, it was weird!) The location is solid..close to lots of Santa Monica attractions, the beach and Brentwood. Like any hispter spot, the staff is light on service and heavy on attitude. The valet parking was comical. It only works after 7am so, my 5am request for car led me to a 4-block walk in the dark thru town to a gated parking lot. $36 and, it became self-service and ridic. No other amenities or services here, which you could find elsewhere and should. No gym, no restaurant, no drinks and no air conditioning either. Bathrooms are functional and old-school, as long as you don't need to rotate your body 360-degrees. No room for that. For reals. I'd throw a party in the lobby, with its Harvard frat house 1962-inspired decor. Sweet. But, for another night in West LA, I'd pass on the pale and stay somewhere in the post-JFK era.","Thank you for your review. I apologize that you had some challenges with our parking. We are working to improve the parking situation. In regards to the design, we definitely have our own unique style, and we don’t claim to be for everyone.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"I wanted to fall in love with this property as I travel to LA on business every month for a week and was looking for a new ""home away from home"" in this area. It was appealing to me because it was apartment-like and when I spend so much time there - that characteristic is important to me! Like other reviewers, the parking situation is near-impossible to manage. I was told they needed to valet far away and to allow 5-10 minutes to retrieve care but it was consistently 25 minutes at least to get car and when in-town for business, I don't have the luxury of such time. I understand it is a issue with the city regulations but it makes for a very challenging stay. The room decor is wonderful but the bathroom shower (in my room) sprayed out over the entire tiny bathroom and created an ever-present smell of must. The no A/C was bearable as I was there on a beautiful cool week but imagine it would be a problem during the hotter months. Lastly, I was overcharged for valet parking nights which they kindly reimbursed. Overall, would recommend of a great lazy beachy weekend which I'm sure it was meant to cater to but there are some improvements that could be made for other travelers.","Dear stefftravels_12,Thank you for your review. It is always nice for us to hear from our guests on things that they really loved about our hotel as well as things that need improvement.I am sorry to hear about your experience with our parking situation.

Palihouse Santa Monica,20,"We loved staying at the Palihouse Hollywood and were so excited to try this place by the beach, especially since it's dog friendly. It's in a gorgeous, historic building in a great location, and it's got great design but the service leaves a lot to be desired. The one or two valets have to park your car miles away, I believe, so even if you call in advance it's unclear if they will be getting your car or just waiting to see you, and then you might still have to wait quite a while for your car. There is no A/C in the building and rooms, and even if people say you don't need A/C by the beach, don't listen. It can get pretty hot in the summer, and we were there during a heat wave and ended up leaving early because of the unbearable heat. There's a cute little kitchenette in the suite, but they weren't able to locate a microwave (that we'd been told we could request) for us even though they offered to microwave our things if we'd like. There's no pool (which would have been good for the heat wave) although I think you can go to the Annenberg beach house) and the gym they have a ""deal"" with is Equinox, where you can pay $50 for a day pass. (That's the ""deal""?) Eventually I believe the kinks will be worked out because the Palihouse is a great chain, maybe the restaurant will be open later than 3pm eventually, but for now it's not up and running in a way that makes sense to seasoned travelers.","Dear Cindy C,Thank you for your review.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"We had a bonus here as we had booked it's previous incarnation (Embassy Appartments) and arrived to find the place fresh done up and looking very spruce and indeed lovely. Obviously we were paying the rate we booked which I gather is significantly less than they ask now since it's new ownership.For any Brits reading this it kind of reminds me of Soho House meets Babbington House in the way it's done up and it does indeed look fab. Our room(s) was magnificent - big bedroom, living room, dressing room, kitchen but let down by a bathroom/lavatory that it is no bigger than a telephone box - madness. Much more sensible would have been to convert the kitchen into a beautiful bathroom than this poor excuse (bathrooms are important if you are spending the several hundred dollars a night that this place charges).Onto the service - well this was pretty mixed unfortunately. Smart looking blazered gents behind reception looked the part but were pretty ineffectual at times and just seemed to chat among themselves instead of actually running the place. When we arrived, whilst I was unloading the car they saw my wife struggling with suitcases and heavy bags and didn't come to help her, just turned the other way. Exactly the same happened on our departure. I don't care whether it's their remit or not, they should just bloody offer to help.We had booked for the four of us and they seem surprised when having seen the room upon arrival we asked where the children were going to sleep as there was only a double bed and had to ask them to go and get a rollaway bed for child one and make up the sofa for child 2. We also only had two towels provided for the four of us so we asked for two more to be told that they had run out of towels currently - $600+ a night, seriously?Anyway back to the positives, aside from being a beautiful place that will only be enhanced when they get their liqour licence, the valet and breakfast staff were excellent and efficient and always looking to go beyond the minimum (learn from these guys Front Desk blazer staff). The location is excellent - a few minutes walk from 3rd St Promenade and a few minutes walk from the ocean.If they get the service right this place will be excellent and just about justifying it's premium price. Until it does, it will be poor value.","Dear NicL,Thanks for your review. We are thrilled you thought your room to be magnificent! We of course would also love much bigger bathrooms in all of the rooms but in the keeping of the historic listed 1927 building, we kept things as is. It does however sound like you were staying in one of the rooms with a smaller bathroom as a majority of the bathrooms are at least 3-4 telephone boxes in size. :-)I would like to however apologize that you were disappointed with the service from our Front Desk staff and want you to know that we take this feedback seriously and have addressed this with the team as we endeavor to provide excellent customer service at all times.We hope we can welcome you back again sometime soon so we can prove to you we are worth the extra two stars.

Palihouse Santa Monica,30,"Loved the décor and the staff very friendly. A few problems though: since there is no air conditioning (which is fine), we had to keep our windows open. Our room faced the street and it was noisy. The walls are thin so we heard every conversation and moving around through the night. In the bathroom, there's a little sign asking to hang up your towels in order to conserve water but there were no hooks or towel racks in the bathroom to put them! Had to drape towels across the sink and tub. Was looking forward to sleeping in late but housekeeping started vacuuming by 9am.The large common area downstairs is gorgeous with a huge fireplace that I would love to revisit with friends for a cocktail (once they get their liquor license).","Dear Karen S,Thanks for your review. We are happy you loved the décor and found the staff to be friendly. We also sincerely appreciate your feedback on the bathroom hooks and have since added additional hooks in the bathroom closer to the tub (there are 4 currently behind the bathroom door which we understand can be easy to miss).

Gateway Hotel Santa Monica,20,"Website needs serious improvement. It didn't clearly offer a medical procedure discount, but learned about it on check in from front desk staff. About 20% discount, so significant for multiple rooms and nights. We originally booked two rooms for one night. Added another night to reservation by speaking directly with hotel and was charged a higher rate for the existing reserved night. Yes, that happens when you change a reservation...BUT, the second night was at the same original rate and the first night rate was higher. That's weird. I told the front desk staff I could have made a separate reservation for the second night and saved $40. Spoke with a manager who bluntly refused to correct overcharge or provide adjusted reduced medical rate. Car parked in the underground garage was broken in to. It's like a bloody crackhead free-for-all around there. VERY NOISY Santa Monica Blvd, so bring your earplugs because you will need them. OK, now the few positives. It is clean, other staff were nice. You can get a weird cash back thing from Guestbook membership. They had a very little continental breakfast included. It's close to UCLA and Cedars Sinai medical centers.

There are quite a few restaurants as well as a Whole Foods within about 10 blocks but when traveling alone on business it’s so much easier to have something in the hotel.

Gateway Hotel Santa Monica,30,"This is the second time we have stayed hereIt’s really easy to get to and from the airport, it has free underground parking at the hotel.Room was big, the bed comfy, there was a fridge and tea/coffee maker in the room.There used to be an IHOP next door that we used, but this has now closed like a lot of them, there will be a new restaurant there soon, but before then the hotel provided a free breakfast in one of their conference rooms, which was great (saved a bit of money)This is not a cheap hotel, but most of them aren’t around this area, but it was good for us, easy to drive to la if we wanted( we just drove to warner bros tour this time)Not far to drive down to the main part of Santa Monica, park on 4th street and then walk around 3rd street(which is pedestrianised ) and then onto the pier.I would recommend this hotel for its position, friendly staff and at the moment free breakfast , but it isn’t cheap","Greetings Grizzler 53 from Sunny Santa Monica!Thank you ever so much for your lovely review and we are so happy that we could be your home away from home for the second time while visiting Southern California.Currently, our restaurant is closed and we are expecting our new restaurant to reopen late summer and will be sharing all of the details on our website soon.We appreciate you recommending the Gateway Hotel Santa Monica to the T/A travel community and look forward to welcoming you back on a next visit to our beautiful city by the beach!",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: May 2018,"Response from GWHSM, Guest Relations Manager at Gateway Hotel Santa Monica","Responded Jun 8, 2018"
Gateway Hotel Santa Monica,20,"This is a run down, tacky hotel with bad furniture and very poor staff.It is way overpriced for worse quality and service than a Super 8.The receptionist and even maintenance staff are unprofessional and rude.Apparently they get alot of guests using the nearby hospital but my advice is look elsewhere.","The Gateway Hotel Santa Monica offers a very well maintained, comfortable atmosphere while providing the highest level of customer service to our guests.

Gateway Hotel Santa Monica,10,"Is this hotel clean? Yes. When we opened the door to our room we were overwhelmed by the smell of cleaning agents. The floor is tile that looks like wood and I suspect they had mopped their way out the door and trapped the fumes inside. I quickly opened the window and the smell dissipated.That window happened to face the other half of the building across a 2 car wide breezeway. Not a great view.Sheets were clean, bathroom appeared clean. Room was a decent size. Furniture dated.Unfortunately NONE of this matters if a hotel is too noisy to sleep in. This hotel is on Santa Monica Blvd and although our room did not face the street, street noise permeated our room as if there were no walls. Police went flying down SM Blvd sirens full force every 20 mins like clock-work until 2:00 am. Is there that much crime or is it their attempt at scaring ""would-be criminals"" into thinking they have tripped an alarm? Doesn't matter. It kept us awake.Even if there wasn't the street noise, we got to listen to Don Corleone in the room next door belittle his wife half the night. I did call down to the front desk and they might have said something to the guy because he seemed to take a 45 minute breather. But he kept it up until about 2:30 when another party on the floor came staggering in (I assume from closing down the local bars). The walls are just that thin.People started waking up and leaving the hotel at about 6:30 in the morning. We could hear it. Possibly they had just been awake the whole night and were trying to get the heck out.There is no restaurant. It is closed. They do serve a sad breakfast in one of the meeting rooms.You are about 10 mins from the 3rd Street Promenade and 18 mins from UCLA. The price of the hotel is CONSIDERABLY cheaper than anything in the surrounding area.However, in my opinion, cheap and clean does not make up for no sleep. I simply do not understand how anyone could give this hotel above a 2 dot rating. If you do choose to stay here because of the price, BRING EARPLUGS.","Hello JLynch7471,Thank you for taking the time to tell us about your experience.

Smelt musty and old.

On the third day, it was announced that breakfast is no longer included, and all guests lost 3 hours of running water, and 6 hours of Internet service starting at noon. Loss of breakfast was a relief as we didn't have to force ourselves eat inedible scrambled eggs with extenders. Not being able to use bathrooms for 3 hours was a real inconvenience as you need to walk a couple of blocks to find a public venue.No extra charge for forcing guests walk through and smell fresh paint fumes in hallways. There is a constant noise of machinery. The smallest bathroom we have seen in the last number of years with 1970s plumbing. Room HVAC needs to be either on cool or heat even though it has a thermostat. Supposedly an Expedia VIP access hotel. The only complimentary feature was a cheap half bottle table wine. Friendly service that can't compensate the intrinsic flaws of the venue. Avoid at costs.","Dear Sir,We are sorry for any inconvenience you experienced during your stay due to the remodel of the guestroom bathrooms which we recently began.

There were a few quirks during my visit but the team did everything they could to help remedy.Good service is good business -- I wouldn't hesitate to rebook at this property again.

It was great to have a single cup coffee maker in the room. I choose not to eat at the IHOP presently on site however I did have breakfast at the nearby Medical Building/Cafe across the street. Great value and quality food at this tiny spot. An extra shout out to Angie.

Gateway Hotel Santa Monica,30,"Here is the thing. My wife were on an extended road trip of the Western United States and had the opportunity to stay at many different hotels, b and b's, and resorts. When we compared them all side to side for comfort and value added features and amenities, this hotel property in Santa Monica ended up at the bottom of our list (out of 7, including other BW Plus properties).First let me focus on the positive. It did deliver a pretty standard, clean, secure room, circa 1990. Price was moderate, compared to other similar hotels in the West Los Angeles region. Yes, our stay was relaxing and uneventful. It was pretty far from the beach, but we knew that beforehand. It was located a few blocks from the LA Metro Rail system, which I think was it's best positive, as it allowed access to the rest of the city for $1.75 one-way. And, by far, it had the strongest free Wifi signal of any hotel that we stayed in (that actually extended as far as 3 blocks from the hotel!).If you stay at the BW Plus Gateway in Santa Monica, it should be a decent stay.However, when compared to other more modern hotels (including Best Western Plus) that we recently stayed at, we were disappointed to find that there was no free breakfast included, though there is an IHOP restaurant downstairs with LUNCH and DINNER discounts for hotel guests. And it may be a little thing, but after many days on the road, we were disappointed to learn that there was no guest laundry (coin-op), necessitating a late-night laundry expedition down Santa Monica Blvd. Parking was free, but the underground garage was decidedly old, very tight, and a bit creepy, as it was open access from the street. Being frugal/practical travelers, we had some of our own food with us. There was a mini refrigerator in the room (good), but it was unplugged, and required moving the whole cabinet out in order to plug it in (bad). Also, we had grown accustomed to a microwave oven at other Best Western properties, but no big deal (just a bit more missing value). Finally, not necessarily their fault, but our room was directly in front of the elevator and adjacent to the ice machine/vending machine and the sounds of Monday Night Football could clearly be heard from the adjacent room. This made our stay a bit noisier and less private feeling.Overall, I would conditionally recommend it as an ""ok"" overnight option. It was not terrible, we thought. But, there are those small things, the ""plus"" in Best Western Plus that seemed to be missing (that were included at other BW Plus hotels).","Thanks so much for sharing your in-depth review of the Best Western Plus Gateway Hotel with the Trip Advisor community. We appreciate you mentioning the strength of our complimentary wifi which is a great travel perk!

Gateway Hotel Santa Monica,30,"The hotel looks nice and the beds were comfortable. Compared to other hotels in the area, you can't beat the price for what you get...But, if you are being nit picky, this hotel has issues. Cleanliness isn't perfect. There was someone else's hair in my sink and one of the comforters in my room was dirty. The gym had low end equipment, it was small, and lacking free weights. The cable machine was ok. It's obvious that the hotel was renovated. You can mostly tell by the shoddy work done under the hallway carpets (lumpy). If you arrive late night, beware, there isn't access to garage elevators and the front door of the lobby is locked, so make sure to get someone's attention. Also, for access to the gym, you have to sign out a physical key, which is totally bizarre and unnecessary. Also, there is hardly anywhere to get food nearby late night.

Gateway Hotel Santa Monica,20,"Booked this location since it was among lowest rate in the very expensive SM area. Checked in and quickly determined that our planned 3 night stay would change to only 1 night. Room was small including the bathroom, not carpeted, just bland and basic. The hotel is badly in need of renovation. Felt we had checked into a drive up motel. Parking is free - thats a good thing. But they don't offer breakfast or even coffee in the morning. No coffee? -couldn't believe it, how cheap. There is an IHOP next door and hotel offers 10% discount but only on lunch and dinner and not breakfast. Since breakfast in the only meal most customers would eat there, this discount is of no benefit. Location is in mid town SM, still about 1.5 miles to the beach, the pier, or 3rd street promenade for the shops and restaurants. So you'll either have to drive thru traffic or take public bus to get there unless you don't mind hoofing that far. My suggestion is to pay up the additional $100 to stay right near/at the beach for the night and enjoy being close to some many things to do.","Dear Guest,Thank you for staying with us while you were in Santa Monica.

The blinds on the windows are ok but the room is stark and has no color. The flooring would be good but i found hair (really long and I have short hair) all over the bathroom floor. Not the worst when it comes to cleanliness, but could use a little brushing up on the details. Staff were very very friendly and this is a plus. They switched our room when our neighbors decided to be very noisy all night. Elevators and parking serve both the hotel and the IHop which is annoying but not too bad. The area is okay...

Gateway Hotel Santa Monica,30,"We were not familiar with Best Western but thought the Plus would be nice. We should have had lowered expectations, but here are the facts.First Impressions:Small lobby and not the newest of hotels. The staff was nice at check-in. Two computers and a tv in the lobby. Our hope was that the room would be nicer than the lobby.Check-in:You received a parking pass, wi-fi code, map of the area, keys, 20% off coupon for IHOP(lunch and dinner), and instructions for the shuttle that takes you close to the pier and promenade for free. They is a $25 per day incidental fee that is refunded if you don't use any of the pay for use services(they did not mention until I asked at check out).To the room:You key must be used to get to your floor. There are vending machines and an ice machine on each floor by the elevator. The rooms are okay. The sink is separate from the shower and toilet. The tv is flat screen and there is a fridge(ours would not close). They gave us two complimentary bottles of water. No carpet in the rooms which made it seem more like a two star.

Gateway Hotel Santa Monica,30,"My daughter and I recently stayed at the Best Western for 4 nights:The good:- Really friendly and helpful staff- Our room had lovely modern decor- Really clean and tidy roomThe not so great:- I found the hotel a little too far away from 3rd St Promenade and the beach, the walk was about 20 minutes which was fine during the day but I wouldn't do it at night. The hotel does have a shuttle but it doesn't run on weekends and only runs on the hour so not always convenient. A cab ride in to 3rd St was about $10 so not too bad- We were on the 3rd floor and we heard heaps of noise from the 4th floor - constantly- The bathroom door didn't stay open by itself so we ended up keeping a chair against it so we could keep the door open when we wanted toAll in all it's a good hotel, but just a little far away from 3rd St Promenade for us.",Thank you for staying with us!

Gateway Hotel Santa Monica,30,"We booked this hotel for the location. The staff was friendly but prior to my visit I had requested a room on the quiet side. Upon check in, I was told I was on Santa Monica Boulevard and to just keep my windows closed. I get that some decorator was trying for fifties moderne (or it hasn't been updated since the fifties) or some beach theme, but they missed that vibe.The room is shown below. Obviously, some guests and reviewers think it's beautiful. I would not stretch to use that descriptor.The linoleum or Pergo floors are cold and uninviting, the lighting in the room Is either fluorescent or LED, but nearly blue and don't light the room well enough to read a document, and the rooms are dark. I has to prop open the bathroom door with the chair to get extra light in the room. The pinpoint spots over the bed are like interrogation lights. My husband picked up the phone to call the front desk and it fell apart.All in all, it reminds me of a hospital or nursing home. As I said, I'm not here for vacation and it is convenient to where we are going. Would I stay here again? I don't know. I'm having trouble getting past the institutional decor (and I still have to sleep here). It's location is great, it is a very, very basic room, but it is clean and the front desk staff were pleasant. They also provided a fresh remote. On the up side, it's better than sleeping in an actual hospital.","Dear KAKLA/Paso,Our goal is to exceed the expectations of all our guests, and we apologize that we did not exceed yours.

There are vending machines so for water or drinks in the floor . Around 12 km from LAX airport and super shuttle can make you reach at 15 usd something or you can take a taxi which may cost approx 50 usdthere is a ihop resturant which you can use for breakfast which has egg as prime ingredient but nice and cozyWifi though is free but doesnt work good at some part of your room and keep connecting and disconnecting and when asked by reception guys they say yes sorry its a problem we accept thatRest nice bed and tv with coffee maker etc,"Hello INDIAOUTSOURCES,Thank you for choosing the Best Western Plus Gateway Hotel during the American Film Market and for taking the time to share your collective experience.

The Georgian Hotel,10,"We stayed there on May 26, 2019. My wife and two boys ages 12 and 9. My 9 year old was sick and developed a severe cough. It started raining outside so we decided to ride the rain out in the room. The rain stopped around 7 pm, so we decided to go out. As we were about to walk out, there was knock on the door. I opened the door and was greeted by a short man, who claimed that there were ""several"" complaints about noise. he carried on saying that we I was fighting with my wife and ""choking"" someone in the room. Now these are not assumptions, he was in fact stating these comments as if he was 100% sure, because a number of guests called and complained. Now remember, my younger son had a severe cough and couldn't stop coughing. So we go down in the elevator with this manager, as soon as we get out of the elevator we were greeted by the Santa Monica PD and I was detained, frisked, my personal belongings were violated, and I was embarrassed at the situation. They checked my knuckles as my kids were crying at this awful scene, later being asked ""does daddy hit you?"" by the SMPD. This was the most embarrassing situation I had ever been in and I will never let this go. We later demanded our money back and checked out of the hotel and went 2 hotels down to enjoy whatever was left of our 1 day getaway. I wish I was making this up but unfortunately I don't have that kind of wild imagination. This was the most horrific experience I've ever had in a hotel and this was a defamation of my character by the hotel. I understand that someone called and complained but before calling the police and having me cuffed maybe you'd want to check the facts? At least that's what I would've done.","The safety and security of all guests and team members is of our highest priority.

The Georgian Hotel,10,"I had booked a table for High Tea for my 90 yr old mother, as advertised, online. When we arrived, we circled 5 times as there was no evidence of the valet. I finally parked at the valet curb to assist my mother out of the car. Once we entered the restaurant, we were told that they don’t serve High Tea on Holidays despite the advertisement, and the chef had cancelled it the week before. We also were told that we should’ve received a phone call alerting us of this. How disappointing! My mother is limited what she can eat and was looking forward to some traditional tea sandwiches. We stayed for lunch as it would be impossible to get into another restaurant without reservations. My Mother ordered a sandwich ( a club sandwich on Mother’s Day!). but could not chew it wjell so did not eat it. It was the only thing thing that interested her on the menu.

The Georgian Hotel,30,I loved this ‘Gatsby’ themed hotel. The staff were friendly and we got fresh ice and chocolates delivered to the room every evening. Perfect location for the pier and site seeing. Parking is available which was handy but I’m not sure if on comparison was a little expensive considering we had already paid to stay at the hotel.

The Georgian Hotel,30,"We booked this hotel because there were some good reviews and it has a great location. We were a bit disappointed, and maybe we should have read a few more of the reviews. The room we had was very small, the furnishings were fine but it was, as I said, small. There are 2 elevators that can be very slow and the stairs are a bit strange. It's an older building and that can all be part of the charm, if that's what one likes. We had hoped for a bit of a view but it was ok that we didn't have one as we didn't spend much time in the room, anyway.I think one of the issues here is that the doors to the rooms don't close quietly and unless you are careful, they make a good bit of noise. For a light sleeper, it was a huge issue for me. We also had awful neighbors on our floor who allowed their toddler into the hallway to play at 6:00 am, on the weekend. They repeatedly slammed their door and basically ruined our stay there. The front desk staff said they'd switch our room later in the day. We informed them that we would be out all afternoon and into early evening and they assured us it would be fine if we moved after dinner. Then they called us as we were on our way to dinner and said that someone else needed a room and that unless we could come back to move, we'd lose the other room. Yeah, that wasn't going to happen. Not that I blame them, they need to be profitable; we were just hoping to be away from the piggy family. We find quite often that families are getting worse about keeping their children quiet in public places and it's a pet peeve. One small child can disturb an entire planeload of people, or floor in a hotel. I can go off on a rant here, sorry. But I will repeat a lesson learned. Call the front desk immediately if you have a noise issue and have them send someone up to handle it. It would be nice if they could fix the loud door problem, too.","Dear Judy,Thank you for reviewing your recent stay. We appreciate your feedback.

The Georgian Hotel,30,"Stayed for 2 nights at the end of our road trip at the beginning of September 2018. Wanted to stay on the ocean front near the pier. I have an aunt and uncle who live not far away so wanted to be close to them. A lot more than I would normally pay for a hotel – a whopping £750.00 for 2 nights, not including breakfast – but I suppose that’s what you have to pay if you want to stay in this location. The hotel looks great from outside and has a nice veranda and lobby but our room was small with a view of nothing. Small bathroom with a badly fitting door which you had to shove hard to close. Also the door knob looked like it was about to fall off. My aunt and uncle came over for breakfast which we had on the veranda. It was good watching the world go by but the breakfast was average. Didn’t have a lot of actual breakfast things to choose from, it was more like brunch/lunch. I don’t know what it cost as my aunt and uncle treated us but I bet it was a lot. The valet parking was very efficient. It was good staying in such a prime location but for the price I expected better. If I ever visit Santa Monica again I would definitely stay in a hotel away from the ocean front where I’m sure you’d get better value for money.","Dear hailesTotnesDevon,Thank you so much for taking the time to review our property in such detail.

Having stayed here last night after convincing my partner to leave a beautiful hotel in Orange County I booked a queen room for 1 night so that we could be closer to the airport as we have a 12 hour flight back to the UK. We have paid $450 for the most basic room with NO breakfast included. We have been put in a room next to the elevator which we heard throughout the night. We have heard loud scraping noises of what I presume is coming from some sort of cleaning cupboards right next to our walls. Then Somewhere underneath our room chair and table legs continually being moved around. We literally have had no more than 3 hours sleep.

The Georgian Hotel,10,"Pretentious staff, old noisy elevator and paper thin walls were the highlight of my trip. Overrated hotel with staff that is disrespectful and condescending. Maids go through your trash and who knows what else. I felt violated and was called a liar. I was told I smoked in my room even though I did not. I was charged $250 for smelling like cigarettes even though I smoked outside. They claimed I should have thrown my butts on the street instead of putting them out and disposing of them in the trash. There are no trash cans or ashtrays outside the hotel, but was told they had them. They must be invisible. They claim other guests smelled smoke but that’s not possible since I went outside every time I smoked, even at 6 am. I am disgusted by the treatment I received. If people smell smoke in a room that has not been smoked in, they are not being honest or they are delusional. I was told a team of smoke smellers were in the room to investigate and my room smelled so bad they had to shampoo the rug? I have never been treated this way and will be sure to get the word out about the extortion I experienced. Beware of the maids, they will look for any reason to charge you, even go through your trash. Overrated!","Dear Dina D,We are so sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your stay with us. The reason for our no smoking policy is to to keep the hotel and guestrooms free of any residual odor as well as not to trouble those who are occupying neighboring rooms, guests with asthma that may be affected, and also the next guests checking into that room which we promote as smoke-free. We value to the safety and comfort of our guests which is why we do have to enforce this policy.

The Georgian Hotel,20,"We chose an ocean view suite, one of the property’s nicer accommodations. All was very acceptable, large, very nice room with a great view. Toiletries were rudimentary. I guess bolting the liquid shower soaps to the wall is now as acceptable in premium “luxury” hotel rooms as in a motel off the interstate. The ONE piece of unbranded, unwrapped bar soap was approx 1.5” square. The major issue was at departure. My shower went fine. Several minutes later, my wife steps into the tub/shower and pulls the knob that redirects the water to the shower, and the knob breaks off. No shower for her. I had to bathe her by repeatedly filling the (tiny) ice bucket and dousing her like this was a camping trip or something. We were in a rush to check out and get on the road, so no time to call housekeeping or maintenance and wait an hour or two for repair. At the front desk, I gave the broken knob to the clerk and pointed out that my wife was unable to shower. The clerk helpfully assured me that they would make sure it was promptly repaired for the next guest and gave me the kind of no eye-contact apology that makes it clear that that’s ALL you’re getting. No offer to knock $50 or $75 bucks off the room charge for the inconvenience or comp the $40 parking charge or even offer a free breakfast in the coffee shop. No, my reward was knowing that the NEXT guest wouldn’t be inconvenienced. My thought at that point was that I should have either hidden the knob somewhere in the room, or stick it back in the hole for the maid (or better yet) the next guest to discover. I’m sorry I didn’t. I’m not coming back here, so screw ‘em. I’d hate to have a serious problem in this place and have to contend with indifferent “I just work here” employees.

The Georgian Hotel,20,"We chose this hotel because of its proximity to the finish line of the LA Marathon. My wife and I stayed two nights. Their version of an Ocean front room is a window. We always stay in ocean front rooms when we stay near the ocean. This is the first time we had one without a balcony. It seems most of the surrounding hotels have balconies. The room was spacious and clean. The bellman/valet were friendly helpful and courteous. The front desk staff was incompetent or worse. Check-in was the worst check-in experience ever. We booked through a well known 3rd party service and was garunteed a rate. The hotel would not honor the rate.... even after I showed them my confirmation. Then... They said all of our cards were being denied. They offered us a less expensive room. What??? We contacted the bank while standing there at the desk... we put the bank on speaker and they confirmed there had been NO ATTEMPTS to charge the card. The 2 night - $1,200 charge would have no problem being approved. The banks for the other cards said the same thing when we called later. Charges were never presented. Miraculously... a charge went through. Then upon check-out they charged $1,200 to one of our cards... and put a $1,200 hold on another card they still had in their system from the check-in. This all happened at check-out.We are an interracial couple. I have never personally experienced racism... but my wife has. She had the distinct feeling they did not want us in their hotel. I don’t know what it was.... I just know it was a horrible experience and made the mental challenge of running the LA Marathon even more difficult. What was supposed to be a fun and challenging weekend turned into a stressful ordeal.The bathroom amenities (shampoo, conditioner, body wash) were all in a rack attached to the wall. You had to pump it 4 or 5 times to get out a decent amount of product. Room service was mediocre concerning food quality and service. The elevators (one fairly modern, one older) were very slow. We stayed on the 7th floor so coming and going took a while. The WiFi was the WORST! . I have only experienced WiFi this bad while staying at a resort in a underdeveloped country. It was so slow.... Netflix wouldn’t run at all. YouTube videos took forever to buffer... and then kept stopping to catch up. Obviously we will not stay there again.","Dear Bill B,We are saddened to hear of the troubles you experienced during your stay and would really appreciate the opportunity to speak to you in person.

The Georgian Hotel,20,"This hotel has the promising of being good. BUT, a few niggles wipes out the positive for me. I don't mind paying a higher price, but for the price I expect things to be ok.The pros.Location good , room size ok, ( we had a suite as 4 adults sharing) a stocked mini bar including snacks. And service polite ( well on day one anyway)...It was clean.Cons.The sofa bed is rock hard...and I don't mind a hard bed but there's hard & hard !...The shower wasn't particularly hot. Nor did the conditioner pump work, which for someone with long, thick hair is an issue! Surely house keeping would check this ?.Cups.... 4 people in a room... 2 cups for the coffee machine.... phoned reception at 17.30 after a long day to ask for a couple of cups & it's now 23.45 & still waiting !!! Fine if it were just me & my partner, but my elderly parents are with us so ensuring thry got a coffee,/ tea was more crucisl than us...not good considering reception said they would be brought right up ! Also why 3 coffees and 1 tea.... why not offer 2 & 2 or 1 of each for each guest ? You don't know what a party of 4 likes so, if all 4 like tea only 1 person gets a drink!One of the card keys didn't work either.But my biggest bug bear & really makes me cross, even at home, if you tell your guests your bar is open til 22:00pm then make sure it is !!!!.... we came back at 21 : 45 & thought we would have a quick night cap.... we were told abruptly, the bar is closed. I said, no, on check we were told 22:00.... we have 15 mins. To be told, oh, ok, well you have to take it to your room.Fine, I said.... a drinks menu was be grudgingly given to me, my parents felt intimidated so wouldn't order a drink, so only 2 of us ordered... I have no problem taking drinks to our room, but 'hello we are your customer'... a bit of tact might come in handy! Drinks came, we paid, & started to head to the elevato...at which point we were told we could drink them in a couple of chairs & bear in mind there are 4 of us, by the door ( my parents are a couple of years off 80)... no thanks,, we took them to our suite.I do not expect a bar in a hotek to shut early, I can understand if you aren't staying here,, but we were.And, as 4 of us staying my parents had the bedroom & my partner & I the sofa ""rock ' bed .... we packed it up in the morning, to come back after a long day to find it made up....Great... really helpful.. not...... other than a lounge chair & one desk chair where were 4 of us meant to seat for an an hr or so before we went back out..Obvioulsy on our bed!So long and short is, I'm still waiting for some cups so my parents &, us can have a cup of tea / of coffee, the conditioner pump doesn't work , a card key doesn't work, and your bar shuts when it likes....woul","Dear sara b,Thank you very much for taking the time to review our property.

The Georgian Hotel,30,"Great Location, however if you are looking for a traditional type of hotel, this is not for you. The hotel lobby is basically part of their restaurant. The Day staff was very friendly and accommodating, the night staff was not very pleasant. When we got to the hotel it was around 10:30 at night, there was no one at the Valet, my husband had to get out of the car and go inside the hotel to ask if someone could valet our car since they do not have self parking and if we could get help with our luggage - we had 2 small kids asleep in the car. The same person was the valet and bell hop and before he even helped, he asked if we are going to be tipping him and he said nothing less than $10 which was very unusual. My husband helped him carry all our belongings from the car to the luggage cart inside the lobby and then the guy took it to our room. The person working at the podium (front desk) did not even get out of his seat - he was sitting the whole time he was checking us in - no hello, no thank you and no welcome - the hotel itself is more of a boutique hotel, which can be nice but this one is very outdated and needs renovations badly. I rate this hotel an average because of the location, but really if it wasn't for the location, it would be considered less than average - I will not stay here again. Also, no pool at this hotel - I guess i must have missed that part when i was booking so no points taken out for that. Do not go by the pictures, the pictures do lie and its not as nice and updated as the pictures make it out to be. The room are spacious so that's a plus.","Dear MistiZahid,Thank you for sharing.

The Georgian Hotel,30,"Location. That is what you are paying for. The hotel is old school and has a great charm about it. The suites are very minimal. There is so much unused space in the suite that a family of four has plenty of room. The bad news is, only one small closet, two tiny dressers, a mini bar you don't need, and there is no fridge. I learned after my stay that one could have been provided. Don't you think they should ask that upon check in if you want one? Also the promise that my 13 year old daughter would be comfortable on the settee couch turned out to be not true. A roll away bed was needed at an additional cost of $30 per night. Parking is $38 a night. The valets are pretty solid and not much wait time to get your ride. The restaurant is very over priced. Average breakfast for four $100.00. And as I saw in previous reviews, do not get 410. Right outside the alley and the garbage pick up is 6am everyday. If you are in the bathroom, you will hear the next rooms bathroom with such clarity it is quite unnerving. Don't get me wrong, this place has potential but for the price I am sure you can find a more modern place to stay. And if you think you can stroll right outside and hit to beach, you have about a mile to walk. Once across the street, you will have to find your way to the path, make your way down the hill, then over the walk bridge and then about a football fields length to the water.NOTE: Bagel Nosh at 17th and Wilshire for breakfast. Great prices and big portions.Hit Rite Aid for water and beers.Drive down to Venice and park and walk right onto the beach.","Dear Drew P,Thank you for staying with us and taking the time to share your experience.

The property looked beautiful online and was conveniently located among Santa Monica attractions. Unfortunately our say was marred by several issues. The front desk was only staffed by a single person when we arrived, leading to a half hour long wait to check in. While I was attempting to check in my wife was accosted by the valet staff, who were much too eager to keep things moving outside.

The room itself was not exactly as pictured... it was supposed to have a separate bedroom, but the doors were see through - so no privacy. Also no locks on the bathroom. Shower water took 10 min to heat up. Bedding/pillows was not very comfortable IMO. There was the tiniest lobby, if you can call it that - and the elevators were super old fashioned - scary. no pool....No quick place to get food on site, but plenty of places in surrounding area.

The Georgian Hotel,30,"We stayed at the Georgian hotel for 2 nights in September 2017. We chose this hotel because of the close proximity to the pier. We booked a bed and breakfast / parking package which cost $785 for 2 people for 2 nights. Room was clean and beds comfortable. The only complaint was the breakfast. On the first morning we went down for breakfast and the waitress asked what sort of coffee we wanted, we ordered and then asked what we could order from the menu as we had pre booked the breakfast, we were then told we could only have standard coffees and order one thing each off the menu. The items on the menu ranged from cereal or fruit or toast or pan cakes at e few dollars to steak and eggs etc, but we couldn’t order fruit and cereal together without paying an additional fee even though it would cost half the price of the steak and eggs. I believe we paid a premium for this hotel but to scrimp on the basic things let’s it down, how much extra would it cost them to give you cappuccino instead of a standard coffee, these small things are the difference of an average hotel and a good one, so only average rating.","Dear kilbyt007,Thank you for sharing your experience at The Georgian Hotel!

The Georgian Hotel,30,"Pros:Rooms were clean and had a better view than the hotels I normally stay at in the area. Staff was courteous. Room service was quick and pretty good.Cons:The rooms are dead-silent which is typically a good thing except you can hear a pin drop in the hallway. Turning on the A/C helped drown that out but it made a loud clang every time it would engage and disengage. I measured that interval to be equal to the amount of time it takes to start falling back to sleep.The ""modern"" elevator was broken during my 4-day stay so all guests and employees had to use the much slower, older one. I took the stairs several times after waiting a while but that in itself was frustrating. There's no stairwell, just separate flights that connect each floor.My last issue is admittedly something that would've required the staff to step outside of their policy but those are the sorts of things that keep people coming back. On the afternoon before my last night, I was able to find an earlier flight so I took it. Once I had confirmation I immediately called the hotel to give up my room. It was escalated to a manager who informed me that I would've had to give notice before noon. That's totally understandable but would've gone a long way towards giving The Georgian a second chance.All things considered, the stay was ok but I'll be returning to my normal accommodations on my next visit to Santa Monica.","Dear Les_Vegetables711,Thank you for staying with us and for the nice comments in regard to our location, room service, and courtesy of staff.

The Georgian Hotel,30,"This hotel is overpriced. We spent over $400 for a king-sized room that was placed right next to the elevator. We checked in late at night close to midnight, so the elevators weren't running. But I was woken up early in the morning (around 7:00AM) due to the elevators running up and down. It didn't matter it no one on our floor was using the elevator, it's the only elevator in the entire building so anytime anyone on any floor pushed the elevator button, you could hear it whirring. It was really disturbing.I complained to the front desk about it, and they didn't take my complaint seriously. I was told upon check out (11AM), that there was no manager on duty but she would get in in the evening and would call me when she got in. At 5:00PM, I returned to the hotel and asked to speak with a manager who told me that there is always a manager on site, that she never got the message to call me. They tried to comp me free valet parking, but we already received the free valet parking because we checked in so late. In the end, they only refunded us $50.If the room was $200, then I would be fine with what we received, but $400 for a room right next to the elevator?

The Georgian Hotel,20,"This hotel is poor value-for-money for an Santa Monica ocean front hotel. We paid $450 (incl. tax) per night for 3 nights for an ocean view room.The windows are tiny, so you can only stand at the window to look out to the beach. The rooms are small, carpeted and stuffy. The corridor also smells musty and old. The only saving grace is the sea-green tiled bathroom, but still that's tiny.If you insist on an ocean view hotel in Santa Monica, I recommend Hotel Shangri-La, which I stayed at 2 years ago. The ocean view rooms are bigger and have a full view. The bathrooms also also way more comfortable. Pricing was similar to The Georgian.If you just want to stay in Santa Monica, I highly recommend the Palihouse, which I stayed at last week for $473 (incl tax). It's also a historic hotel, but with spacious rooms and fantastic amenities and service.In the same trip, I also stayed at US Grant historic hotel in San Diego, which is absolutely fabulous (huge comfortable room, great service) and only $250 night.I was very disappointed by this hotel. That photo in the banner is not a good example of its rooms. Regret I didn't take photos to show you how small, cramped and old the rooms were.","Dear JocelynT852,Thank you very much for your recent stay and for taking the time to write your review.

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"Freehand LA is more of a hip hostel with some private rooms. Design is dark and moody, interesting with art nouveau and craftsman palettes in exceptional and woodwork. Picture a broke arty hipster scored a 1930s marble and steel office space and made it habitable by pier one items and curated primitive vintage furnishings, that’s the Freehand LA vibe .Amenities are sparse with only single towel and pillow with inexpensive rustic cotton Mexican blankets, and little space for personal items in bathroom or on floor. Don’t count on using the pool unless it’s early morning, as it’s thronged with 20 to 35 year olds in high party mode since it’s a popular cocktail bar open to the public.Observed young people smoking cannabis blunts on rooftop at all hours and smelled it on our floor (not the hotels fault but a constant reminder of our decadent declining culture).

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"1. I stayed in one of their dorm rooms recently. Four beds. The cost was ~$100 per night. This is not cheap, especially when compared to hostels -- which the four-bed room setup resembles. I was a bit surprised therefore that I was supposed to provide my own lock for the in-room lockers. This would make complete sense if I this was a $30 per night hostel. But do you really think guests paying $100 per night are likely to be carrying around their own padlocks? Zero of my other 3 room-mates had their own padlocks2. The room has an attached bathroom, shared amongst all room occupants. To re-iterate, this is a room that could be shared between 4 complete strangers. Why therefore, would there NOT be a lock on the bathroom door 🤦‍♂️? Who decided on the setup of this room? What system did they have in mind for ensuring that room-mates wouldn't accidentally walk in on someone using the bathroom facilities?3. My shower curtain (room 213) had an inner plastic lining that was a good 4-5 inches shorter than the outer fabric curtain. This is gross. That fabric curtain is just soaking up water that's splashing up from the shower floor. If you're the sort of person that appreciates carpet in your shower room, you probably won't mind this at all.4. The shower curtain ended ~3-4 inches above the raised shower cubicle tiling. Outside the shower cubicle was the toilet and sink. The fact that the shower curtain ended so high above the shower cubicle meant that it was impossible to shower without water splashing all over the toilet / sink area floor. This means the bathroom unit is in a complete state with water everywhere -- making it hard to be a considerate room-mate to my fellow guests. This is such a basic thing that I can't believe I have to write it. Has hotel management ever tried to actually use their own facilities?",Hello There! Thank you so much for taking the time to let me know about your experience! This isn't what I want to hear at all!I am so sorry you went through all this and I want to make it better!

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"I booked two nights in a shared room for 4 at the Freehand while on vacation in August 2019. Loved the downtown location, very close to plenty of food and entertainment options. Short drive to Hollywood and other destinations. Felt very safe walking around alone in the area.The hotel facilities were fabulous. Although I never ate at the restaurant, the cafe that was open from 7am-2pm had great beverage and snack options. Cafe staff were friendly and welcoming. The lobby area had a chic hipster vibe, and many hotel residents and cafe patrons would hang out there throughout the day. Cool place to meet people from all over the world, especially if you're staying in a shared room. The pool and patio area on the roof was also a great place to hang out. Although the interior of the hotel was pretty dark and cold, I appreciated that after a long day out in the heat.In general I found that the hotel staff had attitude, as if asking them for help was inconveniencing them. Also, during my stay, one of the maids made up the bed (#3) of a guest that was staying another night, but not the bed of a girl who had checked out. Therefore another person got assigned to bed 3 and the original guest came back to find the personal belongings she had left on her bunk missing, someone in her bed, and the other one unmade. Throughout the day myself and another guest went down to the front desk to inform them of the error, to which we were told it would be dealt with. It wasn't until 10:45 pm and another complaint being made that not one, but two staff members came up to the room to sort out the mess. This should have been dealt with much earlier so as not to disrupt the other guests who were trying to sleep.Over all, the actual facility itself made up for the poor service, and I would probably stay here again regardless. I must also say that the value of the shared room was excellent. I paid only $50 USD per night.","Hello Christina! I want to thank you so much for your feedback!

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"Stayed 3 nights as a family (2 + 3 kids 17, 14 and 9). The hotel confirmed a reservation of a King bed plus an adjacent room for the kids but we ended up in a room with 8 bunkbeds - and 'no discussion as the hotel is full' from the Reception staff. Not exactly what was promised and changed quite a bit the feel of the stay. The untrained staff at Reception showed no empathy for the situation and have too much of an attitude. Lobby is cool, but here again, staff comes first. Valet and Door Staff add zero value. Roof top pool area and bar is crowded and seem to be catering for external events rather than in-house guests.

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"Me and my fiancé stayed here for 3 nights and the end of a 2 week road trip through California. We expected a lot from L.A in general because it’s L.A but let’s just say we wouldn’t rush to come back. The area surrounding the Freehand is o.k and close to bars, restaurants and metro lines. There is however a lot of ‘crazies’ outside the hotel and walking late at night can feel somewhat uncomfortable. The room we stayed in was nice and comfortable however a tad small given the price we paid. The staff were really nice to us and accommodating which was really helpful. My main gripe with the Freehand is the rooftop bar/pool. This was a huge part of us booking in the first place and on arrival we were told it had been privately booked on the 2nd night so we couldn’t use it at all, which was a massive let down. The main problem is that anyone can use it regardless of whether they’re staying at the hotel or not so most of the time it was full of what I can only describe as Hollywood yuppies which made us feel a tad out of place (but that’s not the hotels fault). When we did use the rooftop area to simply relax the music was so loud that it wasn’t relaxing in any way and the parties lasted late in the night making it hard to sleep.The hotel did the job for us and I’d be happy to recommend it to friends and family, but the issues with the rooftop area were just hard for us to ignore.",Thanks for the review and feedback Jess!

Freehand Los Angeles,10,"First, after making hotel reservations, I made reservations at the Broken Shaker. I was told it was $50/per person which would then be a food/drink credit. Fine. Except at the bar, the $100 I paid was NOT credited. I was then assured it would be done by the front desk at check out. The front desk had no idea what I was talking about and made me pull up emails to prove it. I did. They assured me it would be taken off. Just looked at my account. Of course it wasn't. They also promised to remove the $50 breakfast of cold disgusting eggs and toast we ordered and didn't eat. That ""room service"" breakfast came in a brown paper bag with plastic utencils BTW. I can't adequately describe how bad it was. The breakfast charge also has not been removed. Second, we paid $400 a night for a room. It was a decent room. Certainly not worth the price. The bed was basically on the floor, the mattress was terrible and the windows were filthy. Best of all though, we were awoken at 7am by protestors (ex employees apparently) directly outside our room...banging drums and screaming into a megaphone. FOR AN HOUR. A quick google search pulled up multiple protests of this hotel!! I wish I had known that before booking.

Freehand Los Angeles,10,"We stayed at this hotel last night. The workers were on strike. We didn't see any employees working the whole time. The hotel should have told us that the workers were on strike when we booked because if we knew this we would have booked somewhere else. The hotel was very pretty, but not clean and no service because there were no employees there. The hotel needs to negotiate with these workers so that they can get back to work or else they need to tell guests about the labor dispute when booking.","Hi Taylor,Thank you so much for reaching out!

Freehand Los Angeles,20,"After visiting the Freehand in Gramercy Park, NY - I was so excited to book a two night stay in downtown LA. Upon arrival, I was guided through self-check in at a kiosk and was given my key and pointed towards the elevators. That's it for a welcome. Efficient, I get it and that's ok.Upon entering the room, which were bunk beds (fine for myself and teenage daughters) we saw the bedding was minimal, the room was cold and the amenities were spare. As we moved through our evening and morning routines, I discovered there were no wash clothes, shampoos, conditioner, shower soap or hair dryer in the room. All of these were readily available at the front desk, but why did I have to keep jumping on the elevator and asking for things that should be standard?The bedding was very odd. The top sheet wasn't made up into the bed, but was folded on top of each twin. So I had to pull apart the bed and make it up myself. (No thanks). The blanket were the $5 ones you buy at the Tijuana border crossing. Very LA, but not warm enough in a very chilly room. We had six twin beds in our room for three people and we ended up pulling the bedding of the unused beds in order to make our own beds comfortable and warm enough to sleep.There are lockers in the hostel-style room we had and it would have been SO NICE if each locker had a little bundle of wash cloth/shower amenities and an extra cozy blanket inside. This is a hotel after all, not a hostel. Been there, done that.Lastly, the second morning, after using the gym, I stumbled upon coffee and light breakfast in the adjacent guest lounge. Great! Assuming it is for guests - there was no note to indicate otherwise. Would have been nice to know this was on offer the morning prior when we were dashing out the door and wanted a quick bite.9+ for design. Restaurant is stunning, just stunning. Halls too dark, great for hangovers but a tad depressing.2 for hospitality. Lots of great amenities but why require guests to ask for everything?","Thanks LadyExecutiveKat for this feedback, we definitely value it and will be sure to implement multiple improvements where applicable. I love that you enjoyed Freehand NY and wanted to experience LA as well, so am very sorry we dropped the ball in our hospitality compared to theirs. WE have a different room set up that allows our bunk rooms to be bought by bed alone instead of the whole room which means we do not necessarily prepare the room as a private until it is booked as such. With your reservation we did overlook that preparation so sorry again for the inconvenience as we always place toiletries and wash clothes ready in the lockers prior to arrival. Thank you again though for the review and we hope we can still entice you back for a much better stay next time round.

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"The Freehand is a very cool spot. It's very trendy and has a cool atmosphere. Those are the highlights. On the downside, although it is a hotel, I would not recommend staying here if you are trying to rest. It's very loud because they have a roof top bar and a huge lobby bar and restaurant. Now, if you are looking to have a good night out and don't mind not sleeping, this is the place for you. I enjoyed my stay there and would go again. Just not for sleep.","Thanks for the review and feedback Jess! We always value what our guests have to say so thank you for taking your time to reach out. I am very glad you had a great time eating and drinking at our outlets, but am sorry the noise from them did alter your overall stay. We do have alternative rooms available that are on the south side of the building and face our specially painted artwell mural wall offering the best night sleep in terms of noise. Finally, we also have complimentary earplugs available at the desk as needed too. I hope these help for next time Jessica and we look forward to having you back soon!

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"Hotel is very well located and the grounds are nicely decorated and kept. A mix of hispter and ethnic vibes through and through. The room was well decorated and clean.Staff is cool though it feels like they're more used to cater for yound crowds in for the trendy hostel experience than other type of clients. The bar and the restaurant are however of another calibre. Drinks and food are tasty and the staff very professional.The rooftop is as pictured and offers a nice relaxing area to have a drink, a smoke or a swim while enjoying the sun.Now for the stay itself. I booked a single King Room with City view, which was more a City Road View. Just saying im case you'd expect one of those amazing Skyline View. The hotel doesn't offer those. The problem though is that double glazing windows didn't make it to the director to do list and the sound of the street (people, car, sirens, etc) made it impossible for me to get one night of good sleep. And I was on the 7th floor! Remember this is downtown LA: it's busy, there will be noise at all time. When asked to change rooms, I was told no room was quiet but offered ear plugs. Really...? Needless to say I'll never stay there again and wouldn't recommend it to anyone hoping to actually sleep.You can sense that it's all about making money, with full basket of snacks, stocked mini bar but nothing to prepare a free tea or coffee. They even charged me $15 I still to figure out what for. There was a nice branded tote bag and sleeper on display. I suspect it's for one of those, which proves, if needed be, that they're really after any little bucks they can make. Here I thought is was a gesture considering the price and the little you get for it really ($950+ for 4 nights).I'd say, go have a drink at the bar to enjoy a free live concert or a meal at the restautant (Exchange Restaurant) but stay away from the hotel. There are plenty of others nice ones in the area for the same price or cheaper that offer elegant and quiet rooms + all the other services and amenities you'd expect for a nice stay whether on business or holiday.","Hi SunBeetle thank your for the review and feedback. As always we value all responses not matter the guests experience as we know we can always improve, so thank you for taking the time to let us know. I'm very happy you got to enjoy our hotel amenities such as the restaurant and rooftop bar which you clearly enjoyed! Their service is certainly top notch and their product just as good, so I am thrilled you liked them so much. As for the hotel, it is a shame you were not able to rest adequately. We have a variety of rooms ranging from city to skyline views. As you stated you booked a king city view but there was the alternative of a king skyline view which is from the 8th floor and up which does offer downtown skyline views, unfortunately the day of your stay we were at a full occupancy and therefore unable to assist with a alternate room, simply the complimentary ear plugs to better assist with the noise of DTLA. I would like to mention though that on less busy days we are always willing to assist guests move to whichever room best suits their needs... often if that need is a quieter room we certainly offer several options such as our artwell or cozy skyline rooms which are on the south-side of the building (away form the street) and very quiet rooms. We certainly respect your choice though of another location for accommodation downtown but just wanted to clarify that we do offer quiet rooms that block out all street noise and that we always aim to assist guests whenever possible. All the best though SunBeetle and we hope that you still come back for some delicious cuisine and drinks when you're next in LA!

Freehand Los Angeles,10,Booked a room for two and they gave us only one king with no alternatives to switch to. Everything is cramped and extremely noisy. The whole place is annoyingly dim like they are trying to save on power. The staff were not terribly amicable or compromising when it came to switching rooms. The price and 4 star rating make zero sense.,"Apologies for your less than valued experience with us Main S. Unfortunately we do only offer two room options at the hotel; a large king bed or a quad room with four bunk beds. If you booked a room for two it would have clearly stated with your confirmation that it was a king bed room as that is all we offer. I apologize if you thought otherwise but certainly your confirmation would have let you know of the specific bed type. Our bunk bed rooms are specific to our shared accommodation and can be sold as individual beds or bought as a private room, however that night we were sold out of those rooms hence we were unable to assist with any room other than a king bed. It is a shame this small oversight of checking it affected your stay with us so much, especially given the great time many of our guests have with us as evident by our many other reviews. Our four star rating is certainly something we find a great honor and put down to our service, atmosphere, design, collaboration with local vendors and hotel amenities such as rooftop pool and bar, 24 hour gym, free wifi, lobby bar and restaurant. Hopefully you can still return in the future Main and we can ensure you get to experience all of those and more as well as the room that fits your needs best!

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"A funky hotel in a great location to explore LA. Staying in a large private room was great for 2 adults & 2 kids. Hotel offers excellent rooftop bar and pool, a good cocktail bar in the lobby and a restaurant.A very good hotel however the breakfast is awful. - A small room in the basement offering cheap bread and an apple. Either stop providing breakfast or do it properly.","Hi MichaelsP, thank you for the review and feedback, we definitely value both. It's great to hear you enjoyed all aspects of our hotel and especially the large family room. It is unfortunate though to hear about your experience with our breakfast options as I believe you were utilizing our hostel guest breakfast and not our hotel guest breakfast. We have multiple options for breakfast with our restaurant, cafe and room delivery specializing in it for those in a private room (our hotel), however our downstairs communal kitchen with complimentary breakfast is specially for those in our shared rooms (hostel). This is as you stated, rather simple but for obvious reasons given it is a quick, easy and convenient way for those economical travelers to begin their day with a grab n go style spread. The upstairs options are far more wide ranging and detailed, starting from around $5 at our cafe. I have no doubt that if you had experienced these you would certainly hold a different opinion of how good these options can be! I hope that helps clarify things Michael and that you still see our value as a hotel, all the best and happy new year!

Freehand Los Angeles,10,"Stayed at the Freehand for 4 nights for sister’s 30th. It is advertised as a hotel, but is actually a hostel which is really run down. You will have bunk beds with lockers instead of wardrobes. They don’t have housekeeeping rooms are dirty and the shower has no pressure to have a shower or wash your hair. The staff are unfriendly and unhelpful. People were smoking cannabis in there rooms and this caused a strong smell within our room, this was reported too staff and they had a don’t care attitude. Please don’t stay here for the money we paid it was not worth half the money. Dogs are allowed including the restaurant which is not hygienic.","Hi Ashley, I am certainly sorry to hear your stay was below your expectations... we make it fairly clear (even through a third party booking site like BDC) that our rooms are bunk beds and laid out as such - so I do apologize for you feeling that it was falsely advertised. I am also saddened to hear about the other issues with your stay as I see you were here four nights but never came down and let us know any of the above. We always want to make any issues right, especially whilst the guest is with us, so I am sorry you didn't come down in person and let us know about your less than stellar stay. As you can see from the myriad of other reviews on Trip Advisor and Booking.com where you booked, the vast majority of guests that stay with us love all our facilities, concept, design and staff attitude and engagement. Finally our property is non-smoking and whenever someone stops by the desk to let us know we immediately send our security team to investigate and remove the smoker or guest as our priority is always the comfort of those with us, unfortunately as you chose not to inform us whilst with us we were unable to do so. Furthermore, our property is pet friendly but NOT our restaurant for obvious reasons, if the guest has a service animal then that is always the exception. I do hope you're able to take on my feedback as well, and ideally give us another chance in the future! If not then that's no worries either and we certainly wish you safe travels for the rest of your journey back to the UK, all the best, Elizabeth.",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: September 2018,"Response from ElizabethP3803, Manager at Freehand Los Angeles","Responded Oct 6, 2018"
Freehand Los Angeles,20,"We walked into the lobby with its ""atmospheric"" lighting (bring a torch!) to be greeted by the raucous noise of a live band sharing the same space as Reception. Check in was a shouting match between us and the poor receptionist - we were unable t hear her and gave up trying to get answers to our questions.Our bad first impression got worse upon entering an elevator that was so dimly lit we could barely see the buttons! The 7th floor corridor (and we assume all the others) was dark, gloomy and depressing. As we left the lift on our floor I commented on the lack of light and a fellow guest replied that the Freehand only had two light levels - dim and dark.We spent 45 nights in hotels during this visit to the US, and the Freehand was disappointing. Our room was small and the furnishings inadequate. The bed was very low, the chair more suited to an office and the retro decor shouted ""hostel"" rather than a highly priced luxe hotel. The bathroom looked nice, however wasn't practical as there was only one very small and low stool to use as a vanity - not even big enough to hold our two wet packs.The restaurant, reception and housekeeping staff we had interactions with were friendly and polite.","Hi Glenys, thanks for the feedback and review. I can't say I'm stoked that we let you down in certain areas, but I am happy you've taken the time to let us know where those areas were. We always value feedback no matter the nature of the issue or the context of the guests stay so thank you for that. To address the lighting in the hotel and rooms; they are a conscious choice of our award winning design team Roman & Williams, and although not the most favorable cup of tea for everyone, we feel the ambiance it creates and aesthetic it adds to our overall design leads itself to the best guest experience for the hotel as a whole. But, of course, to each and their own and we greatly value your input and are sorry it wasn't what you expected or allowed for the best experience you while you were here. Similarly, as with the lighting, at the time of your check in we did have our famous ""Tuesday jazz nights"" on, meaning there was a band playing in our lobby for that night only. Again, I know it might not be for everyone and we can certainly appreciate that, but as a whole we feel it makes for a great night of culture, music and entertainment for our guests.What was great to hear about was your interactions with all of our staff and how their service and professionalism went above all. This makes us very happy that although our decor might not have suited; our staff certainly did. I hope you find this feedback helpful as we have yours Glenys.

Freehand Los Angeles,20,"Upon arrival we were told we had not paid anything for the room. Contrary to my belief the staff were insistent that I hadn’t paid anything yet so I had to put $455 dollars on a credit card. Once checked in our room I check statements and I had already paid the full room rate through the third party hotels.com. I returned downstairs and asked for a reversal of a transaction, after some time they reversed the large transaction on my card and apologised with a drinks token for 1 person. My guest and I were rather baffled that we were only given one voucher after all there was two people. This was an incredibly stressful experience and I felt that this unfortunate event combined with general poor customer service meant I could not enjoy my resulting stay.","Ellen, I am very sorry to hear about this issue with your recent stay.

You won’t find pictures of the basement kitchen and its mold smell on google, nor of the tiny rooms with the cavedio view. Stuff definitely unhelpful. Not worth to tell my whole story. If you are looking for a comfy hostel with basic but useful amenities this is not the place. No space for long trip luggages, no space at all in the room, uncomfortable bunch beds, not enough lighting, no hair drier, noise. Least not last: washing your own dishes is definitely very normal in a hostel, but with a clean sponge that won’t make your hands stink all day. Only pros: positions, view from the rooftop, rooftop bar and pool, general interior design. Sorry if this is harsh but it couldn’t be more honest.","Hi Irene, I am obviously really disappointed about the issues with your stay. To recap it seems some of the hostel aspects of our hotel fell short; such as the size of the room and the breakfast lounge. It seems you were with us for a week though so I certainly wish you had informed us at any stage throughout your stay of these issues, so we could have assisted in many ways. We certainly could have looked to upgrade you to one of our larger bunk rooms or even a complimentary breakfast credit on us at our restaurant! It's a shame though as we simply assumed you were having a great stay with us during the whole 7 days like the many other satisfied hostel guests we have.

Had to approach the valet who ignored me to learn thatvalet parking is $48 per night 😕Check- in took longer than expected (some problem with key activation). The atmosphere in the lounge area by the reception was cool. Once again, no one is helping with the bags. They don’t even have a luggage cart.3 elevators marked as “historic”. 6 person max capacity, small but fast.Got to the room. One of the keys didn’t work, but whatever.Rooms are nice but basic. No coffee machine, no ice bucket, no ice machine on the floor.Bathrooms don’t have locks on them. Showers are average. Windows are thin. Traffic noise and especially ambulance/police come through loudly.Roof top bar is small but cool. Nice music. Drinks are ok. Some mixed drinks were left to me to mix.Pool is very small and shallow.Staff by the pool is nice but all wear different clothes and hard to tell them apart from the guests. Set by the pool, one lady took my drink order. Drink never came. Another lady took the order, again, asked me for room number and name but still demanded my Id to validate that I’m giving her the right name. Drink came this time, not memorable.Back to the room and out to the street for dinner. Good location with lots of nice restaurants walking distance as well as WholeFoods. Homeless people everywhere.Every other block I was asked for money. Not the most pleasant atmosphere. Reminded me of NYC in the early 80s.After dinner back to the room to sleep. Police and ambulance noise wakes me up ( closed windows). Beds and pillows are very comfortable. Towels are not soft.Morning comes and I come out for coffee. First thing I see next to WholeFoods is a big pile of feces ( not sure human or dog). Lost my appetite but still need coffee. Good coffee at WholeFoods. Wish I had it in my room as most hotels do, but oh well.Back to the hotel. Gym in the basement is sufficient but clostrophobic. Lounge in the basement has a common fridge where I can store some items I bought, since I don’t have one in the room. Lounge is nice. Even has a full kitchen. But the strong sulfur smell in the lounge forces me to leave immediately and never return.Spent the day roaming the city. The Grammy museum is awesome, highly recommend it. Had dinner at B.S., awesome food.Back to the hotel. Tons of people trying to get to the rooftop bar. Takes a while to get the elevator in and out of the hotel.Few days later....Checkout is easy. No help with the bags but I’m used to it now. Valet takes forever to bring the car and instead of parking it next to the hotel entrance where I’m standing with all the bags, parks on the corner forcing me to carry them again. There were 3 parking spots by he hotel...strange.Overall ok experience. 4 stars? Not in my opinion but what do I know. I’m told it’s cool and hip. Maybe I’m not...but I still wish I had good coffee in my room.","Jonathan I'm going to be honest - I really loved your review, now obviously I didn't love to hear you had some small hiccups in your stay, but overall it made for a great read and you certainly sound like a cool and hip guy to me!As for those small hiccups I certainly want to apologize with regards to our valet and bell team being less than helpful with your luggage, I would like to emphasize though, that your direct feedback is great for us to improve in those areas and ensure it doesn't happen again for future guests so thank you for that.

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"Hotel is in a good location and the décor and rooms are fine. However, the continental breakfast and guest lounge are really poor. The ""guest lounge"" is basically a shared kitchen with a few tables and chairs. Nowhere on the website does it tell you that breakfast is on a first come first served basis, or that you have to wash your own dishes and clean the table before you can use it. Arrived this morning to a disgusting sight, food all over the floor and tables. By the time we cleaned an area the food was being taken away and we were told basically ""tough"". Mentioned it to the manager who was completely indifferent to our complaint. We were not the first person to complain to him this morning. Also beware, we were told on check in that there was no age restriction at the bar / pool. Went last night for a drink (very cool bar - great views) to be told it was over 21 only. According to the manager, the receptionist probably did not see our family when giving the advice. When we explained it was my son that asked he just shrugged. Still one night left, felt compelled to leave the review due to manager's attitude and still here if he wants to discuss. At least he should update the website FAQ to provide guests with more accurate information about the ""guest lounge"" and free continental breakfast as I am sure he would not want to mislead anyone!","Hey Chris, thanks for the feedback and we're glad you're still with us as we'd love to work to make the rest of your stay ideal.I am having trouble finding your reservation though.

Half of the counter space was dedicated to the overpriced snack bar, the mini fridge was slammed full of drinks, and likewise NO counter space in the small bathroom. There were not many electrical outlets available to charge our devices. Smells throughout the hotel ranged from marijuana to raw sewage. On Tuesday night there was a live band blasting in the lobby until midnight. The sound easily found its way to our second floor room. Not acceptable for paying guests that have to rise early the next day. The a/c unit was insufficient at controlling the temperature in the room. It stayed hot during the heat wave in the area.

I am definitely disappointed we did not meet your expectations. I know booking through Hotwire can land you in some unexpected hotels so you must have been pretty stoked to get a 4 star hotel in the heart of downtown!

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"Well, this hotel is not located in a fun place, it is on a busy street. most streets in down town LA are one way so you end up using a Valet service which takes at time over 30 to 35 minutes min to get you car. They park your car in 3 locations, depend on where your car is you may want to have a so so drink at the bar.My room was so small it reminded me of a college dorm room, when I ask the front desk why the room is small and there is no dresser to put my clothes, the response was I got a discounted room, so when I responded to the email of travel site and let them know of whats going on they called the hotel and I got a email from one of the managers of his concerns and want to help, when I responded he never called or took any actions, Thanks!!!Also your room is filled with goodies in the small fridge and baskets, $4.00 for M&M, hehehe, no thank you!!If you like swimming, this hotel has a pool on top which you may like, it is not big but fun to be on top. It does get crowded on nice days, it also has club on weekends.My suggestion: if you really need to get this hotel, park your car daily somewhere cheap and use Uber a couple of times in you stay instead of paying $50 plus per night Valet fee.The best thing about this hotel was the security which come at night and block entrance unless they see a room key.Good luck and shop around, there are plenty of older hotels that are cheaper nearby!!","Hey Frank, sorry to hear it wasn't the best time with us. We strive to improve our guest experience always so we will be using your feedback in areas to improve! Downtown parking is crazy expensive so Uber-ing is a good suggestion for sure - otherwise valet is 24hrs and with in and out privileges, so that can often outweigh the inconvenience of parking far from the hotel or Uber-ing. But like you said! It's also good to be aware of the maze of one way streets downtown too - it can be hectic in peak hour.Finally I am sorry to hear the lack of a dresser was not the best, nor that the minibar items were not complimentary either. Hopefully next time if you decide to return we can impress a better experience for you Frank.",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: July 2018,"Response from Elizabeth P, Manager at Freehand Los Angeles","Responded Jul 27, 2018"
Freehand Los Angeles,10,"Really horrible experience. We booked and paid for the hotel and we were never asked for a check in time, since we had already paid, we didn't think twice when plans changed and we arrived a little late. We were rudely told they had given away our room and it was our faults for not calling. They did not attempt to call or email despite having all our contact information. It was extremely frustrating and to top it off, or to get rid of us the night manager told us to leave our info, its been over a week and have not heard a peep from the hotel. Really left a bitter taste in my mouth - no attention to customers or they just don't care as they can get greedy and double book a room. Oh and the best part, I am still fighting to get my money back from the hotel they sold out from underneath us.","Hi Nicole,Thank you so much for reaching out and I'm VERY sorry that you experienced this.

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"Some great things and some downers about Freehand LA. I would try it again but not a female only shared quad. Also this is MD weekend so really busy. I moved rooms because of smell in the room from roomies rolling their joints and lots of perfume. Second room there was a drama about the lockers and someones lock getting taking off and their stuff being down at the front desk. I did not want to get involved. I slept with my luggage and didn't really sleep well. But I don't sleep great on the road so it wasn't Freehands fault.Weird things with the sheets. the top sheet you put on yourself and the blankets are megre and I am assuming they aren't changed with every guest but thats a yuck factor. We were supposed to get shampoo with our one towl in out locker but netiher room I was in had the shampoo. The first room I was in they brought some up but then I switched. The second room no shampoo. As I was checking out this was a complaint voiced by many others no shampoo. I am guessing that the non us people don't use the top sheet. In fact my roomies used the top sheet to screen out and drape the lower bunk space. I found this sort of disturbing, what if they are in their with another person...The shared quads I was in were very small, no TV, no place to open up luggage other than your bed. The details were nice, big bath tile in floor nice big shower. Everything seemed clean, no arthropods. The windows were big and on the ninth floor the veiw was beautiful really gorgeous. Some noise but not unpleasant. On the fourth floor veiw of the ally wall. The bunks are interesting. I liked the cavelike lower bunk, the upper bunk was a little more work to get in and out of.The management was awesome and helped with my room. I think this was a crazy weekend for them. I have stayed in europe in many shared single sex hostel rooms and this seemed to be very different from the norms others showed when sharing a room.The complementary breakfast isn't a positive experince a simple kitchenette where you are expected to wash your own dishes. Most people were dumping their stuff in the sink, cherrios, apples and weak coffee. Free and basic. At 7 am it was already cramped with 12 people in there.","Hello Arcnom P,Thanks for the valuable feedback regarding your stay in one of our hostel style rooms. We do offer all bath amenities complementary for our guests at the front desk. We only place a towel in the locker for our usual set up. As for the beds, we do replace all linens including the blanket after each guest and do wash our sheets after each use as well as we take pride in providing clean accommodations. We will discuss with our management team your breakfast concerns and see what we can improve upon.

Freehand Los Angeles,20,Me and my girlfriend booked this on the pretence we would have more upscale hostel experience but that didn't prove to be the case.The freehand is basically a trendy hotel with a hostel as an after thought in it.Pros:- rooftop bar looks great at night- the decor is great- the taco truck across the streetCons:- continental breakfast is PACKED (tiny room and hundreds of guests) and things run out quickly- there is no deals or cheap drinks for hostel guests (better happy hours in bars a block away)- lacks any atmosphere in the common room- our room didn't have a lock on the shower OR toilet- the gym in non existent- we were actually over charged twice for our bookingThe shining star in a pretty lousy experience was Nick the manager (the guy with the magnificent 'tache) he made up for our problems and went above and beyond to try to rectify the situation.If you're looking for the socialite scene this is your spot!If you're looking to meet like-minded travellers/back packers up for some fun stay clear ... genuinely,"Damian, sorry again to have heard about the poor experience with us. I am very glad Nick was able to somewhat improve the situation (his tache is very impressive) and he's one of our best so that is great to hear.What I did want to pass on is that the feedback you originally gave Nick, and have repeated here has been addressed. We now have a free walking tour for hostel guests, a dinner and breakfast sandwich special, a hostel beer 6 pack promotion and have improved the process for the shared breakfast in morning most importantly.This is quite honestly a product of your stay and the improvement we are always seeking, so despite it not being the best for yourselves we would like to think that you've certainly assisted others.Safe travels, Elizabeth.",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: April 2018,"Response from Elizabeth P, Manager at Freehand Los Angeles","Responded Jul 27, 2018"

We did not sign any bills, but they did not want to verify anything.The room were not made, the breakfast is very poor and you wash up your own dishes like a youth hostel, which is unacceptable for this price.No shower gels or shampoo either ...","Hey Clement, thanks for the feedback and I am certainly disappointed to hear about your sub-par stay. I apologize again for the miss-charge but I definitely want you to know we have gone ahead and refunded your card completely, so sorry again for the error! And that you should have the money returned as soon as possible. As for the crowded pool it is definitely that time of year where it's becoming hot and crowded especially downtown, so I hope you can understand that we try out best to accommodate the hotel guests as much as possible, when possible. The hostel breakfast that was complimentary with your stay was exactly that, a complimentary hostel breakfast, so I hope you can understand it is important guests ensure other guests are served by cleaning there own utensils and plates. That is also why we offer breakfast at a good rate in the restaurant and cafe for those not wanting to be apart of the hostel community. But again sorry for the miss charge and I hope the rest of your travels are well and we get to see you again soon and can make it up to you then!

Freehand Los Angeles,10,"I recently stayed here a few days ago and was treated less than what was adequate. I received a quote on the phone from the front desk for $50, but when I arrived at the hotel, the quote changed to $200. The gentleman that i spoke to prior on the phone was not present to confirm the previous amount specified so I decided to just accept the amount because I was too tired. Later that night I was kept up by a noise coming from the floor above us (I was on the 2nd floor). I called the front desk a few times but no one answered. Upon checking out a few hours later to check into another hotel because I couldn't sleep, I informed a manager. I explained to them what had happened but they couldn't give me a refund or help me out in anyway. I am so discontented and I hope that they can get their customer service in order.","Hi there Rose, sorry to hear about your poor experience with us, that's never what we aim for. I believe the original room type may have been one of our dorm beds for $50 whereas our private king beds are for $200 so I apologize for that misunderstanding.

There were very few amenities in the room for dorm guests, just a towel and clean sheets. There are lockers but you need your own key. Each bunk bed has it's own light and little shelf with 2 power outlets. I had some crappy roommates but that's not the hotel's fault. I would probably stay here again if I was able to splash out for the single/private rooms because I think that's where this hotel probably shines.

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"Right off the bat, the Freehand Los Angeles is an upscale hostel. My only other hostel experience was a youth hostel in Copenhagen in 1971. This was MUCH nicer! But a word of caution for the timid business traveler--if you need a budget hotel, look elsewhere. However, if you don't mind a trip outside your comfort zone, the Freehand may work for you. Mind you, I'm 67 years old.I arrived at midnight, thanks to a disastrous travel day courtesy of American Airlines. Interestingly, my shuttle driver mentioned a few years ago that the neighborhood was a rough one, but rejuvenation efforts have improved the urban environment considerably.The front desk staff was polite and helpful and the facility appeared to be clean and welcoming. There was a bar in the lobby and another on the roof top. My bunk and locker was in a room with five other bunks and lockers. For the one night I was there, I had four roommates--one other male and three females. I think. The room was dark when I entered and all the other tenants were in bed. I did my best to navigate to my locker via my cell phone screen where I stowed my carry-on bag. I packed a pad lock based on research I did when I made my reservation. I kept my backpack stuffed with electronics and high value items in the upper bunk with me. An electrical outlet in the bunk allowed me to maintain the charge in my cell phone through the night. Although the bed was comfortable, I didn't sleep as soundly as I usually do.The next morning was the most interesting part of my experience. There was no door to the latrine bay that was connected to the sleeping quarters. There were two sinks in the main bay with separate adjoining toilet and shower rooms. The light from the latrine illuminated the sleeping area. I set my alarm for 6:00 am, but was preceded by one male and one female roommate. They were very considerate, but the movement in the sleeping area and latrine ensured I awoke when they did. One other roommate and I jockeyed for the latrine at 6:00 am. I shaved and brushed my teeth in the toilet room with the door closed to be as quiet as possible for the sleeping roommate while the other roommate used the shower and dressed. When she exited the shower, we reversed locations. The location of the latrine is my only negative. I would have preferred a separate communal latrine outside the sleeping area so noise would not disturb late risers.All this for $41 and change is a great price. But, traditionalist business travelers will not appreciate the latrine bay open to the sleeping quarters.Bottom line: the facility is nice, apparently secure, and cheap, but the room arrangement was a huge distraction.","Hey Chip!Firstly just wanted to say we really appreciate your review and the feedback. Glad you overall had a good stay and for the right value! Sorry to hear the layout wasn't what you had in mind or ideal, but we certainly know dorm living in any circumstances can be close quartered no matter the space and timing of waking up, but, as I said sounds like the rest was ideal and hopefully we'll see you back one day, or even taking advantage of one of our private rooms too Chip.All the best with the rest of your travels, FHLA!",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: January 2018,"Response from Luiz R, Manager at Freehand Los Angeles","Responded Feb 5, 2018"
Freehand Los Angeles,10,"Our ""private quad"" room was tiny. No bathroom door. Basic amenities such as glasses, fridge, hair dryer, closet space, desk and chair were all missing. Rooms are cleaned every day, but bed sheets are changed every 3 days. Included breakfast was a brown paper bag that contained one muffing, an apple (not every day), and a yogurt. On lucky days we got orange juice. This may be find for a hostel but if they offer private rooms the amenities should be there too, not just the prices. We rode out the 6 days of our stay but honestly it was cramped, uncomfortable, unclean, and overall a disappointment. We could only find one restaurant, the one next to the lobby, even though there were supposed to be four. We ate there the first night. The food took forever, they decided to stick us out on a terrace that got chilly very quickly, then fumbled our orders. The manager ended up apologizing and writing off the bill. But the damage was done.We were looking for something different from the usual 4-5 star bland, corporate hotel. We found it. Newly refurbished hotel, with parts of it still unfinished. Post-industrial decor is well-done. Ultra-hipster place with lots of tattoos and pierced body parts among both guests and staff. Very noisy lobby. Kind of cool if you're the primary target audience for the place. Staff was friendly, professional, and helped us out any time we asked for help. We loved it that our bell hop moonlights as a puppeteer (or maybe it is the other way around). Valet service was excellent.","Hi there,Thank you so much for your feedback.

Freehand Los Angeles,30,"We booked a single night at Freehand for our family of 5 (3 + 2) for the last night of our US holiday, and also so that we were well placed to go to the Dodger's game that night.Booking was through Booking.com who acknowledged our party size.It's right in the City Centre and you have to drive right up to the door. There's a concierge at a lectern right there who immediately warned me that there was a tow-truck patrolling to take away illegally parked cars. We quickly got our stuff and went inside. The parking is valet parking and is charged. You get a ticket to get your car back. I have no idea where the actual car park is.Check-in was smooth & we were instructed how to get to the elevator. It soon became clear that the hotel isn't finished. Areas were sectioned off by plastic sheeting and you mingle with engineers and builders.We were allocated a nice, but small room with 4 (2 x 2) bunks, separated by curtains. This is called a Shared room. The allocation of an inappropriate room had happened a few times (through Booking.com), but as this was our last night, we'd lost the will to ask to change (& inevitably pay more). One of my children volunteered to sleep on the floor.There's a section of the room made to look like public toilets just off the main part, which contains the toilet and another one with a shower. Sink is in there also. TV, but no 'fridge or coffee machine.There's a very swish-looking bar and restaurant, which we didn't use.Inclusive breakfast was a little embarrassing; they'd be better off not bothering. A cup of coffee and then a small brown paper back which contained a juice box and a tiny muffin. Why?Check out and retrieval of the car was easy, but (& I know it's in a prime location) the price isn't justified. Maybe when it's finished and everything is just-so, but not yet.","Hi Andy,Thank you so much for your feedback and for staying with us.

Well done contemporary decor. Good size beds. Clean rooms. Friendly staff.ConsWear and tear. Furnishings were all pretty dinged up. Pillows were laughably small.

The kitchen had a full sized fridge and microwave but the kitchen cabinets had no cutlery nor any plates whatsoever. Why on earth would you advertise that the room has a kitchen if you’re unable to prepare a meal there?The only other issue was that the bed sheet had a stain on it. Upon advising the front desk, they immediately provided me a replacement sheet with no fuss.Staff were friendly but were unable to advise simple questions such as location of nearest supermarket (not the corner minimart which sells everything at double the price).Great location though very close to Hollywood Blvd and only a $10 Uber ride to Universal Studios.If driving there, be advised they charge $28 for parking car in their garage. Will most likely stay elsewhere next visit to LA.","Thank you snwerznsmiley,We are so glad you chose this hotel as the hotel of your choice for your family. We do have flatware and dishes available upon request our staff would have gladly taken those up to your room. We hope the staff was friendly and tried their best to help you through out your stay.

Wouldn't stay here again for that reason alone personally. Was a little walk back to the room from Hollywood Blvd, wouldn't do it alone without a male with me at night.

BLVD Hotel & Suites,30,"I'll be the first to say it's really hard to find an affordable clean hotel in Los Angeles. BLVD was not terrible but the issues that I had will result in me not booking again. The front desk attendant was super sweet and efficient. For an employee in training, I think she did a very good job.My first problem was when housekeeping told her a certain room number was ready and when I went upstairs, they were fully in the throws of cleaning it. I checked in after 3pm so that was disappointing. She was able to quickly re-accomodate me into a handicap accessible room. I'm not handicapped, but it was a ready room.As soon as I turned on the AC, the room began to smell like urine. I was tired from traveling and just wanted to get some rest so I didn't complain. Next issue, the sheets. I've stayed at many hotels/motels and these were by far the roughest sheets I've ever slept on. I've never experienced this before and as I write this, I'm still surprised by it. I ended up making make shift sheets out of my clothes so that I could get some rest without the feel of steel wool on my skin.The following morning I asked for the filter in the AC unit to be cleaned. I was thankful that they also heeded my request to NOT mask the odor with Febreeze. Although this was done, the smell of urine was still present. Since I only had one night to go, I made another bed of clothes and tried to block out the smell.Overall the location is great and the hotel has potential. If they can address these problems, it would be a great place to stay.","Thank you MetallicaTraveller,We definitely want to thank you for your feedback, it is so important for us to know how was your stay.

BLVD Hotel & Suites,10,"I booked a suite in this hotel a month before my stay. I booked 2 rooms for 2 nights. The hotel lobby offers refreshing and cold fresh fruit flavored water. They also have complimentary coffee but noone told us, I found at by chance the day I left. I had to go searching for coffee to buy for breakfast. The large bedroom with 2 queen beds had a closet in the room. The closet had a light that could not be switched off. The first night, I called the front desk. The clerk came up to check the closet light and he could not figure out how to switch it off. He said he will leave a request for maintenance to fix it the next day. The following day, we were out all day. In the evening, I noticed that the closet light was still on and cannot be switched off. After calling the front desk, they said that the clerk from last night forgot to leave a request for the maintenance guy. I explained that it will be 2 nights without sleep because of this light in the room, and I am very sensitive to that. They said they will inform management of this incident. Apparently, management only offered a $50 rebate on the 2 night stay. That is ridiculous considering that they gave us a room with a defective light right in the bedroom, and that their staff neglected to take proper measures to fix this defect. It’s unacceptable. This was a very disappointing and unpleasant experience. If you cannot sleep well, you cannot enjoy your day. I do not recommend this hotel.","Dear Diane B., Thank you for finding time to share your feedback with us.

The room was nice, comfortable bed etc.They seriously need full length mirrors, I cluelessly got dressed and put on make up every day.The pool is hilarious, we honestly have bigger puddles in Ireland.One night we mistakenly asked for cocktails.The girl behind the bar told us she had no ingredients but made her own version of an old fashioned with a complimentary fly in it. I can't help but think the fly might have jazzed it up a bit, it was foul.You can't fool irish people with crap drink,I was born in a cocktail glass honey.Location was good, especially if you haven't got a car.

BLVD Hotel & Suites,30,"The best thing about this place is the location. We were able to walk to and from a concert at the Hollywood bowl, and that convenience was worth the money.However... as far as hotels go, this place has plenty of room for improvement. When we walked into the small lobby area, there was a strong air freshener smell. Which, I guess would normally be OK, except that this air freshener is one usually used in large public restrooms. So just by association, the lobby kind of smelled like poo.The rooms were sort of bare minimum. I couldn’t find a full-length mirror anywhere, which is a pretty big miss. They don’t cost much and absolutely necessary when getting dressed to go out. The lighting around the bathroom mirror is absolutely horrible. It reminded me more of a black light you use to to look for cancers or bacteria, not to apply makeup. There was no mini bar or snacks available in the room. There were no blackout curtains, so getting a night away from the kids to sleep in didn’t happen. The iron was covered some kind of sticky black substance. Paint was scratched and chipping around the door handles. The cleaning crew clearly isn’t checking for this kind of thing. But the kicker: the bed was extremely uncomfortable. It looked nice. But it was miserable to sleep on. Not good when you need to sleep off a hangover.The rooms don’t have central air (window units did the job though). The pool on site is hilariously small. It’s basically something to laugh at while you’re waiting on the elevator. There is no valet parking or anyone to help you with your luggage. It’s all very do-it-yourself. Which is fine, but doesn’t give you license to call yourself a hotel. This place is more of a recently renovated, clean enough motel. And if that’s all you really need, then go for it. Just don’t be fooled by the pretty pictures.","Dear Lauren M., Thank you for choosing to stay with us at BLVD Hotels. We appreciate your feedback.

The room was clean. Beds were comfortable. Nice fridge and microwave. The room looked very modern (but it a faux kind of way).The things that I was disappointed about:I booked directly through the hotel and made a comment about wanting a high floor because I was celebrating my 50th Birthday while staying there. So don’t bother indicating a special request when booking because no one reads them. Lesson learned that it really does not matter if you book on their hotel website, there are no special perks. So if you find a better deal through another site, book it there.The hotel only has 3 floors. Our room was on the 2nd floor. It was the last room all the way down the hall right next to the laundry facility that the cleaning people used. We could hear the washers and dryers going. Our room faced a concrete side of another building. There were little tiny flying bugs like nats or something in our bathroom all three of the nights that we stayed.All in all it served its purpose and we were not in the room that much each day.

BLVD Hotel & Suites,30,"BLVD on Highland is located close enough to walk to the famous Hollywood Boulevard and all of it's attractions, but far enough away that you don't get much spillover. The room was clean and adequately spacious. Not much of a view, unless you like looking at an apartment building 10 feet away. The pool was very tiny, but we did not use it. The parking garage was nice and somewhat secure, but at $24/night, I kind of felt taken advantage of. The glass shower was missing a door, which didn't matter much since the water pressure left something to be desired. It was literally dribbling out of the shower head. Also, we stayed on the 2nd floor, and while our actual floor felt solid and seemed to be made of concrete, the 3rd floor above us must have been constructed with wood beams and plywood because the woman who was pacing back and forth in high heels ALL NIGHT could be heard as if they were in the room with us. It eventually stopped after I pounded on the ceiling for 10 minutes, but it sure was annoying. The room did have an over-sized mini-fridge which was perfect for storing all the beer I could carry. It also had a microwave that I never used. Not much by way of clothing storage. No dresser drawers. The hutch was packed with an ironing board and luggage stand, no hangers for your clothes. It's a good thing I had a desk to put my clothes on!

BLVD Hotel & Suites,10,"Check in was at 3pm, we got there at 3:45pm and the room wasn't ready. We waited until 5:15pm, to get a room, and only got a room because we complained about the wait. We had plans to go to a concert that night and due to the very late check in, we missed our dinner reservation. The shower was missing a glass door, which got the entire bathroom wet. They wouldn't help us out in any way except to wave their $26 parking fee. By the way, the parking garage was small and filled up. We called the hotel and was put on hold for 15 mins, I hung up and then we had to double park and block someone in just so I could talk to the staff. When we finally got to our room, it was OK, not worth the $280 we paid. I regret my trip there, we would have been better off at the Best Western or the Holiday Inn across the street. Rude staff, and I would not recommend to anyone. There are many better places to get a hotel in LA, and when we checked out they tried to charge us for parking, when they said it was waved, had to argue again with the staff.

I didn't feel safe walking in and out of the hotel on my own.The hotel beds are very soft, mattress is overused and wasn't comfortable.Parking lot costs 25 USD per day and the swimming pool is just a shady water hole, not very appealing to sit by the pool.

BLVD Hotel & Suites,30,Staff is very friendly and helpful. Cirac in particular deserves special mention. Hotel used to be a comfort inn or something and its pretty clear where they just did some cosmetic footwork to re-brand it. Pool is stupid and may as well be a pond. It is tiny and see's no sun. There are no room for lounges or anything like that. They should install a heater and jets so it's at least a functional feature of the property. Room was fine nothing spectacular but the bed was comfortable which is always appreciated. There's also a great mini fridge with climate control....fancy. Biggest complaint is the shower. It's one of those fixed glass open air setups and the water pressure is best described as a trickle. Parking was under the building and always had open spots as I came and went. Walk to everything down there. I was in town for a show at the bowl and we were able to walk up and back in less than 10 min each way. Based on the traffic and the parking lot that the roads become on a bowl night this was worth the price of admission all by itself. Small bar in the lobby but there are plenty of spots within walking distance. I'll stay here again when I go back to the bowl no question. Just need to bring a wrench to remove the water regulator on that shower ;),"Thank you Ryan,We appreciate the words you shared about us.

BLVD Hotel & Suites,30,"I drove up from San Diego for a concert at the Hollywood Bowl, and the BLVD showed up as a proximity hotel. The price was a little steep for one night stay with limited amenities, but it was truly just a stone's throw away from the Hollywood Bowl, a very easy walk. We avoided all the traffic nightmare to and from the concert, and that made the price worth considering.The room was neat and clean, and seems to be going through recent/ongoing remodel. I found the toilet to be extremely worn and old, while the vanity and rest of the bathroom seem recently upgraded.Check in was easy and simple, parking was no-hassle (though $24 a day), and the lobby bar was small but cute.The pool is a joke - it's about 10' square, an unbelievable waste of space and silly expenditure for the hotel. It's also surround on all sides by buildings, so it's rare that the sun ever even makes it into the area. Seems like it would be smarter to fill it in and create a couple spa treatment rooms to generate revenue.There is no ice/vending on the second floor, and no signage to direct you to where it is. It's on the third floor, just in case you end up going there.The fridge was a great size, the bed was comfortable, and most toiletries are provided. There is no breakfast or restaurant, but 24/7 there is a small drink/snack area that is convenient for late night thirst/munchies.All staff I interacted with were polite and knowledgable.All in all I would probably consider staying again for a Hollywood Bowl show, but I would just as easily consider walking further if the price and amenities were friendlier.",Thank you wquinn78 for taking the time to share your thoughts and experience.

BLVD Hotel & Suites,10,"I was willing to give this hotel a great review, everything was good up until the day of check out.The normal check out time is at 11am. A couple of days before check out I had went to the front desk and asked if I was able to check out later than 11am as my flight wasn't until 10:30pm that night and would've liked a longer sleep in. The lady at front desk advised that this is fine and that she can give me up until 12:30pm. I was happy with that so she put a note under my booking that I have requested late check out.The day before my check out date, I went to the front desk again just to confirm that it was still fine for me to check out at 12:30pm as I was previously advised. This time a guy was working, he had a look under my booking and said there is a note there so it will be completely fine for me to still check out at 12:30pm.Now the morning of check out has come. I had my alarm set for 11:00am to get up, shower and then start getting everything packed. At 11:30, a knock at my door. I answer, halfway through doing my makeup. The lady at the door rudely says ""check out was at 11"". I advised her that 2 of her staff members had told me that it was okay for me to check out at 12:30. She rudely responds ""no, check out is at 11"". I again advise her that was not what I got told, and that I not only confirmed it once but I also went in the day before to confirm that it was still okay.Discussion went on, by this time it was roughly 11:40 and she told me I need to be out by 12 or I will be charged $65. I told her fine and slammed the door in her rude face.I then had to get myself, and all of my stuff ready within 20 minutes. Chucking it all in my luggage bag. It was not a great start to my final day.I was planning to stay here again next time I visit but that will definitely not be happening now.Very poor service from this lady, I wish I had gotten her name but unfortunately I didn't.","Dear Romezxo,We are saddened to hear you had a disappointing check out process at the end of your stay.

BLVD Hotel & Suites,30,"I travel quite a bit and this is absolutely a ""good enough"" room. It's good enough for a pleasant trip. There's nothing exceptional about it, but there wasn't anything terrible, either. It reeked of bleach when I checked in, which I truly appreciate! I didn't feel like I had to pull out my own stash of clorox wipes. Light on the mirror was too dim. Lighting in the room in general was insufficient for me. I booked a ""city view"" room and had a lovely view of the next building 20 feet away from my window. No big deal though. Rooms are NOT soundproof and housekeeping was extremely loud on the 2nd floor. I mean YELLING to each other down the hall after around 7 am and particularly around 3pm when I checked in - no naps allowed, here! I guess they expect everyone to be out and about by then. I should say that I live locally and only stayed here because I was seeing A Perfect Circle at the Hollywood Bowl. The property is the perfect location for that (and was totally worth it to not have to deal with the Bowl's parking and traffic/uber nightmare!) It's also just a quick walk to Hollywood Blvd for touristy stuff if you're in town for sightseeing. Plenty of room to Park my truck. The bar was too crowded after the show and the bartender seemed flustered, so I walked to Hollywood Blvd for some nightlife - I can't comment on the bar. The coffee in the room was ok. The small snack store in the lobby was reasonably priced. Check in/out was easy, and staff was polite, but no offer to help with bags or anything, I had to make 2 trips. Overall, it was a nice enough stay and reasonably priced for the area. But I don't think I would be comfortable here for more than a night or two.","Dear Adrianna A,Thank you, for staying with us.

BLVD Hotel & Suites,30,"To qualify, this review has nothing to do with the hotel service. The hotel and the rooms are modern and clean. We stayed at a 2 queen bedroom and the bath area is separate from the sink which is ideal for family members to wash up simultaneously while one is in the shower.The shower screen though, is poorly designed and water tends to spill over through the sliding door gap. So the bath floor is inevitably wet after one showers.The floors are squeaky so if you are not on the upper floor you will hear the upstairs guests moving around, which is irritating when you are trying to sleep in early.The walls are pretty thin and sounds travel from the hallway to the rooms especially if you have annoying guests returning in the middle of the night or are trying to ""play hide and seek"" perhaps along the hallway. I could barely sleep a wink with all those chattering, screaming and yelling across the hallway, plus the upstairs squeaking floors and occasional police sirens as they try to nail a suspect on the main road. So in a nutshell, try to ask for top floor and off the main road for the very least.The front patio offers a good spot to hang around in the evening. We ordered some takeouts and enjoyed our dinner there, which is a better option than eating in the room.Parking is not free, $24 per night in a sheltered parking. It's reasonable if u aren't familiar with the area and don't want to take risks.I hope I will have a more peaceful sleep tonight!","Dear DaffodilBlush, thank you for taking the time to review your recent stay with us.

There were a lot of things that were disappointing:– the heat didn't work (it was a cold night, but we were only there for one night, so we didn't want to switch rooms in the middle of the night)- there was only one lamp in the room (odd) and surprisingly stark, unflattering lighting over the sink/vanity- when we got to our room the cleaners were still in it (again, odd)- lots of dings in the door paint- we had to request bath towels- I don't know what cleaning products they use, but the smell of them throughout the hotel is really overpowering- No safe in the room- Could use more USB outlets (I believe there was one)Service was very nice. Check in was quick and painless (except that our room wasn't really ready). Parking is $25/night - fairly standard. The heat/AC unit was pretty loud, but that doesn't really bother me, as long as it's not kicking on and off all the time (it didn't).

We didn't complain because the LOUD noise only took place during the day, but they did start working early in the morning (even on Sunday). Fortunately, we are morning people and didn't care to ""sleep in"" because we wouldn't have been able to. The front desk personnel were very nice. The room was comfortable, but it would have been nice to have another mirror - the only one was over the sink and my husband and I have to take turns. I thought a full-length mirror inside the wardrobe would have been great and not a pricey addition the hotel could make.","Thank you for staying at The Blvd Hotel & Suites during your travel, we appreciate your positive feedback and understanding during our beautification process to further provide great service to wonderful guests like you!

BLVD Hotel & Suites,30,"Stayed here 4 nights. It is a 10 minute walk to the Hollywood Walk of Fame, about a 10 min drive to Griffith observatory where you can get great photos of the Hollywood sign. And they have a sister-hotel close to Universal Studios where you can park for free and catch a shuttle up the hill to the entrance (It'll save you $18). The hotel itself doesn't have much to offer, the room was alright, although the bathroom reeked of mould. They were doing construction right outside, so you get woken up at 7am in the morning. I don't know if we were super unlucky or if that's the case for everyone but we had some really loud neighbors upstairs, they were jumping around and moving stuff around all night, every night. We called front desk about this several times but nothing changed, apparently they were fully booked so couldn't move us to another room. They did comp us one (??!!) night of parking for this.I would probably stay here again because of the location, but I would ask for a room on the top floor that didn't have mould in the bathroom. And also it turned out to be cheaper to book straight through the hotel than through hotels.com or wotif.com.","Hey Louise,Thank you for sharing about your recent stay with us at the BLVD Hotel & Suites in Hollywood!

La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Lax,30,"We arrived at the international Terminal after a 12 hour flight and waited outside for the hotel shuttle that was shwon on the website. After an hour we called the hotel to find that the shuttle had been discontinued because of COVID. Well, fair enough, but why not at least make a special effort to let prospective guests know. When we eventually made it to the 6th floor where our room was, there was a sickening smell of stale marijuana. The room ,however, turned out to be clean with everything advertised (refer, Microwave, TV, working internet, adequate closet space, adjustable cooling/heating, king sized comfortable bed). So the room was fine. Going downstairs for the advertised breakfast, we found that too had been cancelled. So the price of the room (reasonable) was then increased by taxi fares and purchase of breakfast. Not so much of a bargain after all.",Thank you for your review.

We took a Carnival cruise to the Mexican Riviera, which was wonderful.However, when we returned to the La Quinta after our cruise, we were informed, rather rudely, that check-in was not until 3pm.Several others had chosen the same hotel and the lobby was full of both people and luggage.After waiting over two hours, I asked Stephanie at the front desk, if she thought our room might be ready soon.Instead of responding with even just a bit of concern or empathy, she said very curtly, ""our check-in is at 3pm"".Of course, we already knew that, because that was the same response she had given two hours previously. However,since the lobby was getting full and one man was even laying on a couch snoring, I thought I would ask.Additionally, this hotel charges $25 per night for parking, which was not indicated to us at the time of booking.Bottom line, I highly recommend you find another hotel in Los Angelesand steer clear of Stephanie, the rude front desk person at La Quinta, by Wyndam on West Century Boulevard in Los Angeles.Customer Service 101 is highly needed!","Dear NikE531,I am sorry to hear that your experience was anything less than perfect.

Shuttle to LAX was fine. On our return from LAX to the hotel was a complete disaster. We had to call twice to see where the shuttle was. We waited 45 mins and had three drive by without even attempting to stop. They were empty too. I was placed on hold when we finally flagged on down. They didn’t even help get luggage into shuttle. Our room this time was clean but smelled of smoke and the remote control had no batteries in it. So we couldn’t watch tv.

La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Lax,10,"We arrived around midnight after a late flight into LAX and had booked a family room for 2 adults and 2 children for 2 nights. We noticed straight away that the hotel was undergoing some sort of refurbishment but were assured that as this was taking place some way away from our room we would not be disturbed. Little did we know...The family rooms are at the front of the hotel, just a few feet away from a VERY, VERY busy road. Even with a pair of earplugs each, we were unable to get any sleep at all due to the constant traffic noise from the road outside, which really is just a pavement width away from the hotel rooms. It was honestly like trying to sleep next to a race track.Just after 7am the cleaners started vacuuming the hallways and despite being exhausted, we gave up on rest and went to breakfast, passing by builders, building equipment and all the associated noise along the way.The food itself was basic but included in the price but just as we sat down to eat, a furious argument broke out between a homeless man, who had sneaked in for some breakfast and security, who physically wrestled him away from his table, across the floor of the dining area and out of a fire exit. All this amid much shouting, swearing and racial abuse of the security men by the hungry, homeless guy. It was just awful to see.As we had booked in for 2 nights we asked to be moved to a quieter room but were told in no uncertain terms that there were no family rooms available at the quieter rear of the hotel and that if we wanted to move rooms we would have to pay the price for an extra room (i.e. 2 doubles) to accommodate the four of us.The thought of another terrible night without sleep in this hellish place was too much for us. We booked another hotel and left, forfeiting the money we had paid for our 2nd night as the hotel refused to offer any compensation as we had booked through a booking site.

La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Lax,10,I stayed at this hotel as I was in transit from a trip abroad. After an 11 hour long flight I waited for nearly an hour for the shuttle .I had to call the hotel for them to send it. The food in the hotel restaurant is the most tasteless food I have ever tried and they charge you arm and a leg. The rooms are average . There are only two elevators and they are painfully slow. The hotel is undergoing renovations at the moment and there are a bunch of construction workers who play very loud music. It is almost scary for a single female to be there especially when waiting for the elevator. I would never recommend this hotel.

La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Lax,20,"I don't normally provide reviews but felt it was necessary this time around. I booked this hotel as I were transitioning from one part of LA to another on our family vacation and it seem centrally located. It was too late to cancel so I told the front desk when we arrived that we would be checking out the next morning rather than staying the full three nights. This is when it became frustrating. The front desk told me to call Expedia as they could not change the reservation. Ultimately they have the control and should not have asked there guest to go through this. I called Expedia who stated they would have to call the hotel on our behalf. They were able to make the changes but then the hotel wanted to change the rate to $50 more per night. Again another poor choice by the hotel. I told Expedia that it was unacceptable and they had to call the front desk again and the original rate was finally honored. While at the front desk, the conversation between staff was fairly unprofessional as well talking about not wanting to work at the front desk. The other part of this stay that was a pain was the hotel was undergoing renovations. To me it is a good thing they are investing in upgrades so it was not a big deal to me at first but then it became an issue as the 3 elevators were constantly being used by the construction crews and the cleaning staff. This was a real challenge getting around the hotel even with 3 elevators. Due to that age of the hotel, I guess I should not expect a service elevator. The last frustration was the room did not have wash cloths in the room and when I tried to call the front desk I found the room phone was not operational. I realize the hotel is going through a transition and could look past some of the construction but the front desk issues are unacceptable. On the bright side, the service from the gentleman/(server) in the restaurant at 9:30pm was fantastic. He was very nice and engaging when we decided to get desert.","Dear Valued Guest,We are very sorry to hear of your negative experience while staying with us.

Get to the room & realize someone else’s things are in our room! Oops! Call the front desk & we’re reassigned a new room. The facility is going thru a remodel so there is plastic covers on the ground & exposed wires everywhere! Be prepared to ride the elevators with construction guys & gear. They should of considered shutting down an entire floor at a time rather than booking rooms on floors where construction is underway. Once in the remodeled room, it’s beautiful!

La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Lax,10,"I am super disappointed in this hotel. This is my third time staying in this hotel and it will be my last. First, no where do I see on your website or reservations that the swimming pool is under construction or the oversized vehicle parking is unavailable. 2nd, when I get to the hotel the parking situation is made to be my problem by telling me you can check with the other hotels. Then the lady at the front desk was rude to me when she was helping the girl check us in. She told me she wasn't talking to me when I asked what did she just say to the young lady about my credit card. When I tried to check in early I was told the only way to get the rooms all on the same floor was if I waited until 3. I agreed. But When I came at 315 they were not able to get all the rooms on the same floor. This was everything that happened at check in, after a 7 hour drive. The last time I was at this hotel was 2016 with a school group as well and you were under construction. I thought after two years and your advertisement on your site saying newly renovated January 2019 that the construction would be over. The last time I was here the pool was available and you all had a solution for the oversized parking, plus the staff was super accommodating and professional. Not so much this time. One last thing, my room was not cleaned. The beds were not made, no vacuuming or the restaurant dishes removed from the room. When I told th be front desk once I returned to my room at 8pm they said house keeping was gone and there was nothing that could be done. I want a refund for our rooms. After a long day at a theme park I just wanted to come in and rest. But instead I had to wait in line to find out why our rooms were not cleaned, which by the way was 6 of them at over 130 a night....","Dear Valued Guest,We sincerely appreciate the time you’ve taken to provide such constructive feedback regarding your experience.

La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Lax,10,"The lot is not marked well. It can easily be confused to be the hotel's parking lot. It is a very big lot with a concrete wall extending from the building which goes around the parking lot. My car was towed out of this lot overnight and when I went to tell the front desk staff about it, all they could say was, You parked in the wrong place. No sympathy. No understanding. No apology for the customer's misunderstanding. When speaking with the company that towed my car, they stated it happens 9 times a day which made me wonder if the lot is park of scam and certain parties such as hotel staff and Taco Bell were a part of it. The hotel isn't interested in protecting customers from having this happen before. They place no signage on their building stating the lot is not their property. The sign going into the lot states what tow company will take your car but it doesn't say who's lot it is which could lead you to believe it is the hotel's. The lot is so big, you wouldn't think it belongs to a Taco Bell. When you check in, there is no signage stating you must pay for your parking so you can consider whether you may be parked in the wrong place. The staff didn't offer me parking so I would not know there is any other place to park. There is something seriously going wrong and I have reached out to La Quinta corporate and their local management and the only thing that has happened is that I received 2 days of free parking and no consideration from the local management. Very disappointed and will never visit this property again and I am a very regular client of LaQuinta.","Dear Valued Guest,We are very sorry to hear of the negative aspects of your stay.

La Quinta Inn & Suites by Wyndham Lax,30,"Location and Check-in:This hotel is very close to LAX. The shuttle came up to the front door and was very convenient. There were too many people to get on the shuttle and they called for backup right away. There is a lot of renovation going on at the hotel so it was very hard to find where the entrance to the parking garage was when we arrived.Parking:After check-in, we were required to move our car up higher in the same parking lot. It doesn't matter about where your room is when you park as you must go outside of the lobby to another elevator to get to all parking places. That elevator to parking is so small it barely fits 2 people with luggage. We had to wait for other people to use first and then board. When we left the parking garage after our trip the gate would not open and there is no attendant so we had to ring a bell for service.Rooms:The rooms are neat and clean. We stayed there pre and post vacation and they put us on the busy street side both times. There was a lot of traffic noise all night on the Blvd and it moves pretty fast so it makes it sound even noisier with 8 lanes of traffic going into and out of LAX all night. The only thing I noticed about the bathroom was that there was no hanger/hook to hang up ditty bag. It had to hang in the hallway closet. There is a strip on the wall between the beds that has ample outlets and includes USB slots too. Very convenient.Construction:A lot of construction going on outside of the building so there is scaffolding everywhere. We were on the 9th (of 10 floors) and the construction crews set off the emergency alarms. A very loud evacuation system woke us up and told us to leave our room and walk down to the lobby on the stairs. When we go there, no one had heard it in the lobby, therefore, no reversal of the evacuation sound system telling us it was a false alarm. No one was at the lobby door of the stairway either. We had to wait in line at the registration to find out what kind of alarm and if it was safe to go back to the room.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"We were booked Ito the hotel as part of a multi trip booking so did not select the hotel. We hired a car from the airport and the drive was relatively easy. On arrival we were informed of the $45 dollars per night for parking, too expensive and no alternative available. The hotel trying hard to be modern and minimal, but actually looked like it was undergoing renovations. The concrete walls I appreciate was part of the design, but there were exposed nails/metal, that can be dangerous.There are no in room tea/coffee facilities, although a coffee machine was provided after leaving feedback. The food at the restaurant was too fussy for me and very expensive l, service was ok but not outstanding, we ate dinner and breakfast both we had to ask for the waiter to top up coffee, take order, pay the bill.They were not able to cope with a gluten intolerance, some seemed to understand some not and most weren’t able to assist with the options. This was raised with the hotel and a credit was given in this regard, suggesting more training would be provided.The hotel is located in Koreatown, I was not aware of the location and would not have chosen it - please consider this before booking also.We also had issues with the heating, it worked for 2 days then stopped on the last night, we played with the controls, but by morning it was so cold, we contacted reception who sent up a portable heater, the maintenance man then also played with the room unit, no explanation of why it stoped working.Overall this hotel was not my cup of tea, it wasn’t a holiday destination and the food was not geared up for just snacks, everything was more fine dinning and therefore costly.I would not return to this hotel.","Dear Guest,I am disappointed to learn you did not enjoy your stay with us.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"Had three nights here following 3 in New York before flying to Vegas. The hotel was booked as part of a package so it wasn’t a ‘natural selection’ rather than a ‘punt’. The hotel is reasonably well sited for Hollywood and Beverly Hills visits, but we did have a car so it was easy. We didn’t venture into the city due to limited time. The decor was dated, and the plastic black painted containers stuck to the wall behind reception an dotted around the lobby/bar didn’t do it for me. Also, the plain concrete room walls and corridors didn’t float my boat, despite the (assumed) attempt to be ‘arty’. No tea or coffee facilities in the room and we had to ask twice before receiving a Nespresso machine and cups that didn’t fit under the dispenser. Add $40 per night to park your car, courtesy of valet parking, it started to disappoint early on. On the last night the air conditioning was only blowing out cold air, and a technician came promptly and he suggested that he had opened up the hot water valve to add more hot water through the fans - presumably someone had sneaked in and got in the ceiling and turned it down after our second night then? The restaurant was in a pleasant setting and (as I am a coeliac and cannot have gluten), I opted for omelette as these tend to be safe. Unbeknown to me (and also after highlighting with the waitress) I received fried potatoes with it. Nice surprise you might conclude, however the next day I ordered the same and received salad with my omelette. When I asked the waitress if the potatoes were not gluten free, she confirmed that she, “didn’t want to take any chances”. Life in the fast lane, eh??!! Overall, very pricey and I would go as far as saying a little amateurish and I certainly wouldn’t book there again I’m afraid.","Dear Guest,I am disappointed to learn you did not enjoy your stay with us.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"Went to The Line with my teenage daughter for an social media event. My first impressions as a traditional traveler that stays at traditional hotels (e.g., Marriott, Hyatt, Drury Inn, etc.) are the following:*** Lobby is open concept - the cafe opened right into the sitting area, which was right open to the lobby sitting area, etc....*** Behind the front desk while checking in I notice an art piece on the wall ... a large mosaic of laundry detergent bottles painted black. Interesting.*** The design in the hallway leading to the room is a different take on the ""exposed brick"" concept, but with exposed concrete walls (like the place was still under construction) -- this was very strange to me. I'm used to painted or wall papered walls ... SOME KINDA DECOR PLEASE!*** As soon as we entered the room it was HOT! Air conditioner was not working. I tried to adjust the thermostat, but figured out after an hour that there was a bigger problem. Contacted the front desk, and after ~ 30 minutes someone came and fixed it very quickly.*** The room had great floor to ceiling windows ... a bit dirty but could still see ... however at night that also means you can see everything and every light that is on outside!*The room furniture was BoHo chic (I guess) with a platform bed (a little too hard for me, but my daughter was comfortable. just couldn't get used to the concrete walls*** The frig in the room was stocked to brim with liquor, snacks, etc. ... I couldn't use it for my own stuff (I guess they want you to spend your money on their stuff and not your stuff)*** REALLY NOISY! The hotel is in the center of Koreatown ... lots of activity on the streets through out the night ... and definitely even more noisy with my daughter's social media event taking place at the hotel too ... I had to sleep with my earbuds in ... not comfortable*** Room had a ""barn-door"" type of sliding door for the restroom ... not my preference ... would like to have a closed door*** Lighting in the room and bathroom was a bit dim for me*** Maid service personnel were very friendly ... everytime I left the room they spoke and greeted me very wellThe whole experience was great for my daughter ... she had a blast at her event.Me ... I'm an older mother and business woman ... I'm used to a more traditional hotel when I travel. I missed some of the things I'm used to while staying at The Line. This is probably a hotel more suited to young (or older) pack-packing, free-spirited people just looking for a place to hang.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,10,"Ugh. I was excited to stay here, since I love another one of their properties. But boy was I disappointed.1) As everyone has said, the rooms are loud if you do not face the hills. It doesn’t help that they blast music from the restaurant or somewhere else unknown until late at night. You can literally feel the bass in the room. You can also clearly hear the people in the rooms over. I’m very glad we didn’t stay during New Years Eve or during the weekend, because I cannot imagine how someone could fall asleep then.2) The service is not great. They did not replace the shampoos or conditioners, even when they were empty. The front desk is minimally helpful. They try to deflect, unless you push.3) The amenities are not four stars. The towels are threadbare, one even had a hole in it. The sheets do not seem high count, and feel cheap. They don’t have a coffeemaker in the room, which fine, but they also don’t offer free coffee like every other hotel I’ve stayed at that lacks a coffeemaker in the room.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,10,"I decided to book this hotel after reading all the good review in the web, the pictures look hip and inviting. When we reached for our stay, oh boy, did we just realize that the booking was probably the biggest mistake of our life.Let’s start with the room:The room was really noisy. And I am not talking about noise thats tolerable. When we checked in I requested for a quiet room. Receptionist assured me that it will be a very quiet room, so he gave us a room on the 4th floor. When we went in, the room was just facing air conditioner exhaust and it will be running all night. Bear in mind the hotel property seems to save on developing cost hence not even using a double panel glass. So we decided to request for a change of room. He then gave us a room on the 8th floor assuring us that it will be quiet room. Oh boy, it was a fool me once kind of situation. This time the room was facing the main street and bearing in mind no double panel glass and noise travel upwards, it was like a fiasco of noise that never ends. We ended up couldn’t sleep the whole night. We were contemplating to just change our stay to another hotel and we enquired whether it was possible. Receptionist informed us we won’t get any refund. So we requested for another room change. The last one was on 12th floor and indeed it was quiet.Let’s continue with the bed:The hotel charges north of USD250.00 which is probably similar to the big brand. The bed however is not even close. The mattress sinks in the middle and they don’t even invest in down pillows. It was all a nightmare.The good however was the staff. Staff was courteous and always trying to help.But if the only thing that is good is the staff, and guests sleep quality is compromised due to poor property investment charging at exorbitant price for the low quality. I deeply recommend everyone else to just stay at other hotels. You stand better chance to sleep better.Location is good indeed.","Dear 330krista,Thank you for taking the time to offer your feedback from your recent stay.I am very sorry to hear of the challenges you faced with during this stay.Please know, this is not reflective of our operation standards or wishes.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"Aesthetics and vibe of this hotel aside (you may love it or hate it; personally, I kind of liked it), the Line is a really poorly designed, built, and maintained hotel. Functionally, this is one of the most poorly designed hotels I've ever stayed in. From the signs in the elevator that show the lower floors at the top, to the metal bird hangings that jab you in back of the head if you lean too far back on the backless desk chairs, to the low bare-cornered beds that find your shins in the dark as you try to find the bathroom, to the nearly complete lack of hooks in the bathroom, this hotel screams of design that tries to be ultra-hip with a glaring disregard for utility. Maintenance is also a massive problem at the Line. We visited the pool deck on Friday afternoon to find it littered with trash and used towels. The middle elevator was out of service for the entire weekend, leaving only 2 over-used elevators (which are frequently used by non-hotel guests to go between floors 1 and 2 for the Openaire restaurant). At one point, it took us ~15 minutes to get from floor 12 down to the lobby. But, the biggest problem with this hotel, and the reason that I will likely never stay there again is the windows. We had a room south-facing room on the highest floor (12) overlooking Wilshire Blvd. Despite the high floor, this was one of the noisiest hotel rooms I’ve ever slept in. All night long, you hear sirens and cars revving their engines as they race down Wilshire. There is absolutely no sound isolation from the windows. To make things worse, there is no air isolation either. The air quality in downtown LA was really bad while we were staying there. I’m not sure if this was standard LA air quality or perhaps it was fueled by the nearby wildfires. But, at night I could smell the pollution in our room and feel it in my throat. Inspection of the windows shows that there are actually gaps in each window frame that cannot be closed. From a sound and air isolation perspective, you might as well be camping out on Wilshire Blvd. It’s really bad, and I’d encourage you to really look elsewhere to stay until the hotel does a renovation of all their windows.All of that being said, there are some good things: cool shop (Poketo) in the lobby, great having an Alfred coffee right there as well, location in Koreatown is great if that’s your scene, and the views are pretty great. Does that make it worth it? No. Stay somewhere else until Line gets their act together.","Hello Scott,Please allow me to follow up on behalf of my colleague Alexa.First, thank you for your feedback as we see this as a chance for improvement.I am following up as we have contacted you directly to be able to get a better insight on how we could rectify this experience.I am truly sorry to hear of the challenges you experienced during this stay.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,10,"I must say this hotel was such a disappointment, which saddens me because the hotel itself, design wise is incredible! Such a COOL hotel but such BAD service! I’ve never been greeted with such Cold reception. Our Freind booked the hotel And she was arriving from another country and we were there before her. When we explained our situation they really wanted nothing to do with us, they were dismissive and showed no interest at one stage they weren’t even looking at us looking down at their screen and ignoring us. My freind and I decided to leave our luggage and go for a walk as nothing else was suggested by the cold staff in reception.It was coming to to check in time and our Freind was only a few min away so we called to see if it was ok to wait by the pool for her they said it was fine to do so. The service up at the pool was wonderful, the pool staff were extremely attentive. We sat back I gave my credit card and we ordered some cocktails at the bar whilst waiting for my freind. When my freind arrived it was way past the check in time and as we booked the suite we thought it would definitely be ready in time. After an hour the manger approached us and said the room was still not ready! We explained we had come from Australia 15hr flight and needed to rest before dinner. They were apologetic ordered us a few cocktails and so we waited.. it was another hour until we were shown to our suite we were exhausted. On the second day we went for a walk enjoying the sights until I realized I left my credit card at the pool. I called instantly inquiring of it’s whereabouts but they couldn’t find it...asked me to call again in 5min... I did, they still could not locate it! They explained that the pool staff were managed by a different company! Which explained the much better service! But no one could locate my credit card! I was devastated! We came back to the hotel to spoke to reception, no one new about my Lost card. They said they will contact security so I waited... I think it took 35min to locate him so we sat patiently and waited, still in disbelief. I had to take a phone call so I left my friends for a min to take the call. When I came back I could see my friends in what looked like a heated conversation with reception. My freind approached me and explained that when I left to take my call, the staff were talking behind my back saying “who did I think I was asking them to find my card” “why I would think it was there responsibly”. They were rolling there yes behind my back and speaking ill of me! My freind thought this was disgusting and decided to tell them so! In the end they found my card after hours of waiting stillrolling there eyes! Super horrible experience! Such a shame as it’s and awesome looking hotel with great coffee!

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"Let's get the pros out of the way. First of all, the place is pretty chic, the curtains are remotely controlled (except sometimes it moved by itself), and the staff was friendly.However, our stay was mostly bad. There's no refrigerator besides the minibar, which is too small to actually hold any leftovers. There was only one place to hang a towel in the bathroom to dry. The wall sockets didn't hold plugs very well, making the chargers loose. The carpeted floors didn't feel clean. The rooms are so small that there isn't much space to layout your luggage. The double beds are in the middle of the room, making it really easy to run into corners and hurting ourselves several times.Worst of all, the air conditioner in our first room wasn't cooling properly. It stayed around 75 degrees all night. So, we asked them to check out the air conditioner while we were gone, but that didn't happen the first time. It was only the 2nd time we asked that they sent an engineer up to confirm that the A/C was indeed not cool enough. Then we were moved to another room, which had the SAME problem but worse! Temperature was about 78. They finally checked for a cooler room before having us move all our stuff again, and even told us that it was an ""upgrade"", but it wasn't; it was smaller. It's supposedly an upgrade because of a better view where you can see the Hollywood sign. Whoop-di-doo-doo. At least we were able to sleep more comfortably even though it was our last night and had to leave by 5am.For the inconvenience, they gave me some credit to spend in the hotel, but then somehow charged me $5 on my card.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to offer your feedback from your recent stay.I am very sorry to hear of the challenges you faced with your rooms.I will be sure to pass this feedback along to Director of Engineering to insure all issues arerectified.Please know, this is not reflective of our operation standards or wishes.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"A four star hotel that doesn’t provide basic toothbrush, toothpaste and shaver. End up I have to rush out to buy late at night! There is no kettle too so be prepared to lug water back from the nearest 7-11.Upon checking out, I was being charged an extra $20/night for what they call ‘amenities charge’. Mind you, I didn’t use their WiFi, drink any of their expensive room drinks. So I questioned why is there such a charge, in the end the receptionist told me because I booked the stays using an external website. At this time of age, who still book directly from hotel website?Toilet has a fixed shower head so be prepared to be splashed with cold water each time you turn it on.As per what other said, if you are a light sleeper you better skip this hotel. People talking, laughing, ambulance, police sirens, car horns are nightly occurrence.Went to the pool and there is a big sign that states the seats are only for customers of the restaurant nearby.Ok so what’s good? Well the design is unique. There is a certain style to the room. Bed is pretty comfy. Location is great with a station just opposite. But if you ask me are these enough to neutralize the above cons? Flat no.","Dear Guest,I am disappointed to learn you did not enjoy your stay with us.

They are loud! We are on the ninth floor, this hotel has up to 12 floors, and we can hear everything. They are yelling, screaming, crying. I specifically asked for a quieter room since I am traveling with a baby and the hotel staff assured me that this room is quiet because it is facing the Hollywood Hills and we are on a high floor. But what they didn’t mention is how we would be facing a bar/club (?)? I also paid extra for this Hollywood Hills view Since I was told it would be quieter. I don’t know what I prefer to hear more, street cars passing by on the non Hollywood hills side or the screaming of drunken kids. I would find this hotel noisy even without a baby, so beware! It is loud!!!!","Good Afternoon Esther,I am the Senior Guest Experience Manager who spoke to you Saturday in regards to your concerns about the noise.After our discussion, I am disheartened to see your TripAdvisor review as I thought we left the conversation on a good note with you being satisfied and was wondering if there is anything else I can do to rectify this?

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"We had a nice stay, but it's a pricey hotel. We did get a room upgrade, which we appreciated.When we checked out, they offered to email the bill, and I agreed. Fortunately I checked my email before we left the parking lot.- $45 overcharge for parking. We had already booked a ""Stay and Valet"" rate on the hotel website, and we disclosed this to the valet upon arrival. Upon checkout, they said ""oh, that packages just a discount."" No it's not. The rate is higher because valet parking is included, but they added a $45 daily charge anyway. They took it off.- $20 ""Amenity fee"" = ""resort fee"" in places that can claim to be a resort. This is not a resort, it's just a pricey hotel, and this fee is not disclosed on their website and is pure profit. They did argue that the website states this. Yes, my confirmation states ""The above rate(s) may not reflect all possible fees, additional charges or taxes associated with this reservation."" but nowhere does it disclose the mandatory $20/night ""amenity fee"" that they know about and charge everyone. What prevents them from tacking on another $50 BS fee for toiletries? And of course, this doesn't show up on booking sites, so you aren't comparing a true cost to those of other hotels in the area. Naturally, they didn't refund this fee.So, nice hotel, bad execution.","Dear Lisa,Thank you for your feedback as we see this as opportunity for growth.

The windows are so thin, that you have the feeling of sleeping on the street. You hear every single car, and there is a lot of them.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"My wife and I stayed here for three nights as part of our honeymoon and were left a little disappointed. The hotel is very clean and the staff were friendly, but this place really wasn't for us. I get that the appeal of this Line is that it's a little out there, with the bare concrete walls and modern art furnishings, but to be honest these things didn't really aid our experience of LA. The clientele were very much young hipsters and unfortunately we were in a room next to a loud group who were there to party - I don't have an issue with this, but the joining door between the rooms meant that their noise was quite disruptive when they came home at 2am.In terms of location, we weren't overly impressed by Korea Town, but the Metro stop across the road was quite handy for getting around. Unfortunately, I asked a member of staff for recommendations of things to do locally and he didn't have any!On a positive note, we were lucky to have a great view of the Hollywood hills and the hotel's restaurant, Openaire, was fantastic.","Dear MG89B,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your recent stay.Although, we love and appreciate Sean Knibb's creative design of the hotel, we do understand his vision is not for everyone.However, I am happy to hear that you were able to take advantage of our prime location here in LA.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"If I were making a satiric mockumentary about a fictitious hotel for L.A. hipsters, this would be the place to shoot it. The guest rooms are Spartan - walls are rough poured concrete. The beds are low, with no headboard. The lighting is rudimentary - hanging lamps on cords and floor lamps. The chairs low and uncomfortable. The hallways are plain concrete as well. If you want to buy drugs or meet someone on them, this is almost certainly the right place. There's a $25 charge added to your room bill each day for food, which you can use at one of the restaurants. When I used mine for breakfast, the total came to $25.15 for a breakfast sandwich and coffee, yet my room bill had a $6.15 charge added. When I pointed that out to the clerk when I checked out, he looked up the charge I'd signed, then said he'd need permission from the manager to remove it, even though he admitted it was wrong. He disappeared for 5 minutes, then finally returned and grudgingly adjusted the bill. Perhaps if I'd been stoned, I wouldn't have noticed the mistake. Perhaps so many of their guests ARE stoned that the hotel counts on being able to pad their bills. The hotel IS close to great K-town restaurants, but that's its only charm.","Dear Joel,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your recent stay.Although, we love and appreciate Sean Knibb's creative design of the hotel, we do understand his vision is not for everyone.I am sorry to hear about the confusion regarding your bill at checkout.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"Sometimes a good hotel is undermined by thinking it is a great hotel.The bottom line with The LINE is that everything is too expensive. While any hotel will nickel and dime you, our wedding block charges added up to be far more than we expected (and that we would have received at similar hotels in LA).Parking is $45 a night. Delivering welcome bags to guests was $5 a bag. A thermos of coffee was $18. The only hotel restaurant offers faux gourmet fare at $35 a plate and the lobby coffee shop is an outpost of one of the most expensive chains in the city.And despite the additional costs, you never really feel like you are getting any additional value. The staff never particularly goes above and beyond the call of duty. The rooms are fine. Though our suite was spacious, there was nothing about the decor, the furniture, or the other amenities to write home about.While there is a distinctly hip vibe to the LINE that our guests enjoyed, you leave your experience at the LINE feeling like you would have been better served saying at a more traditional, more boring high-end hotel that knows how to offer value for their hefty price tag.

In regards to the parking pricing, our parking price is market competitive, offering the lowest price while being able to provide seamless service that includes 24 hour valet with in and out privileges in a secured garage.

Room service took an incredible amount of time for a bottle of wine (just go down to the bar if you can - way quicker). Alfred is ok for breakfast, and the lobby bar has friendly but slow service.

Parking is way too expensive and takes way too long until the valet turns up with the car. The rooms are way too small. There is no proper breakfast available, only snack food from a counter with a very hip person behind it, and yes it is overpriced for what you get.

We were moved to 919. There was a strange loud and abrupt noise that came from the vent every 30 minutes or so, disrupting our sleep. Finally at around midnight, we couldn't take it anymore and requested a new room. We were told the front desk had to call the engineer. Um... at midnight? No. We'd like to get some sleep, now, thanks.Room 719 to the rescue? This room was cleaner than the others, and came with a mini bar menu so we could actually see the prices, wow! Unfortunately, in downtown LA, you won't be able to escape the noise from the city, so we still weren't able to get a restful night sleep.

If you're planning on visiting downtown LA the location is great but unfortunately, if you're planning on any other landmarks the location isn't great. I found that there's not much around the hotel to see. This meant getting in the car every time we wanted to go to a museum, to the beach, shopping or to a restaurant.That said, the rooms are clean, modern and have great views of the hills. They have an Alfred's in the lobby which is great but I feel like there should free coffee in the lobby like most hotels at this price point. It's such a small gesture but makes a big difference for guests not to spend $5 for drip coffee.The gym is great - lots of space, cardio equipment, weights and technogym machines. I personally feel like the technogyms are a bit awkward (coming from someone who works out a lot) to use and take up lots of space. Not to mention they were probably really expensive. They would benefit more from more space and free weights.The pool is on the 2nd floor. It's more of hanging-by-the-pool, pool. It has a cool vibe with a fun crowd. The hotel restaurant is next door to the pool which was closed for renos during our visit but I've heard great things. They have a ping pong table and fooseball table available too.For the price, I think it's hard to get a better experience but personally I feel like it was located a bit out of the way.","Dear Jose,Thank you for taking the opportunity to offer feedback from your recent stay.

So i decided to stay here on a family vacation too.Then: the hotel has everything you need: good location in trendy Korea town, with access to freeways, so you can go easy everywhere in greater LA. The rooms are small, but very nicely designed and - if you pay for - you will have a nice view on the Hollywood Hills from your bed. The gym is small, but sufficient... so far so good.The problem starts as soon as you want breakfast. The place is called Comissionary, actually very nicely made, a greenhouse on the rooftop. But before you can be happy about it, you have to get along with the usher. She seems to date from the time of communist Russia, when restaurant guests had no significance.We simply wanted to have breakfast and the lady told us that we had to wait an hour. When we were surprised, because the restaurant was completely empty, she told us that she had to show us how restaurants in the USA work (really! Funny to tell something like this to a 56year old person, who travels about 120days every year, has been in the US possibly already, when this lady was not born at all ;-) )When we told her that we were guests of the hotel and didn't really know what to do in an hour's waiting time in the morning, she said - that's a quote - that she didn't care if we were hotel guests.It was - at first - the last thing we heard from her, because immediately afterwards a colleague accompanied us very friendly to a table and we were served our breakfast immediately and without any problems. Not surprisingly, because the restaurant was completely empty.Now it can happen to everyone that one is in a bad mood, does not react appropriately, and so on. However, the lady who escaped from the former Eastern bloc actually continued her regime the following morning. As soon as she arrived at the counter she wanted to order us around again and at the request that we get another table than the one she offered us in the darkest corner of the restaurant, she started a scene again. It wasn't until I asked for the manager that she withdrew again.I would like to say that the manager apologized for the behaviour of her employee and we were subsequently given breakfast free of charge. I must say, however, that this incident has already spoiled the stay at the Line Hotel and the extraordinarily arrogant and unusually customer unfriendly attitude is probably the result of the success of the Line Hotel, which is flooded every evening by non-hotel guests celebrating wild parties.Let everyone have fun and I also treat the hotel to its success with external restaurant guests. In my opinion, however, a hotel is primarily there for a group of guests: the hotel guests.In this respect, the statement of the Soviet usherette still sounds in the ears: I don't care if you're hotel guests.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time share your feedback from your recent stay.However, I am disappointed to be informed of the poor level of service you experienced from our restaurant. It is unacceptable for you to have been treated in such a way and a poor reflection on us as this is not how we wish to conduct our business. I will be passing this information on to our Director of Food and Beverage to insure this is an issue that is addressed.We see this as an important opportunity for growth and improvement and we always encourage any and all remarks.I hope that i have the chance to discuss this further with you and possibly shift your impression of our hotel as a whole.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"Let me begin by saying that I really, really wanted to like this hotel. It is in a great location for the reason I frequently visit LA.I will mention the positive thing first. The staff, everyone from front desk, housekeeping, restaurant, etc. were very nice and helpful.This Hotel caters to a very specific clientele. It has a very young vibe and a very loud nightclub. It is definitely the noisiest hotel I've ever stayed in. The street noise from Wilshire is one thing, but it was the nightclub which kept me up every night. Not only did it keep me awake until 3 am most nights of my stay, it also prevented me and my 24 year old daughter from using the pool. There is always a party at The Line. The front desk was very accommodating and offered me a different room and also compensated me for the inconvenience. Sadly, there is no escaping the noise.The rooms are tiny. I have stayed in many hotels, all over the world. These rooms are about half the size of a standard hotel room. I'm not exaggerating. These rooms are ok if you are traveling alone and you travel light. Otherwise, there is no room to store your suitcase and very little room to hang and store your clothes. You can't even walk around the king sized bed.The bathrooms could use an update. There were cracked tiles and drippy faucets. The elevators are very slow and hot. The lobby waiting area on each floor is also hot. Not sure if the AC just wasn't working while I was there.","Dear Guest,Firstly, thank you for taking the time to share feedback from your recent stay.It is wonderful to hear that our team made a positive impression during your stay. We pride ourselves on enlightened customer service so it is always reassuring to hear our staff connections with our guest.Although, we love and appreciate Sean Knibb's creative design of the hotel, we do understand his vision is not for everyone.I am very sorry to hear of the challenges you faced with with the in room maintenance.I will be sure to pass this feedback along to Director of Engineering to insure this issue is rectified.Please know, this is not reflective of our operation standards or wishes.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,10,"Hotel is not a 4 star hotel. More like a 3 to 3-1/2 star. Windows are single pane so you can hear everything. I even heard birds chirping. There were noise starting at 4am every morning, either contstruction, cleaning or garbage trucks or something. I had requested for a quiet room, an empty fridge and a microwave when I reserved. I got email saying those will be made available. When I checked in, they did not mention any of those requests so I asked for them. They got me a room facing the alley but it was still noisy as mentioned above. I asked about fridge and micro, front desk lady who checked me in said they'll be brought up but didn't come so I called to request. A man at the front desk said he'll check into it. Again, never came and never got any message. There was a fridge with drinks in them so I just took them out to use so that was ok. Microwave would have been nice to have but was not a necessity so I gave up. The fact that they said they were bringing them but never did and also never followed up on it bothers me.I was there for Anime convention downtown. I chose this hotel because I could book at a discounted rate through the convention which offered shuttle service. Front desk did not know anything about where the shuttle stops. They should know. Rate is way too high for the type of room you get or service they offer or location.Bathroom needs renovation.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts and suggestions.We view all comments and feedback as an important opportunity for growth and improvement.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"We booked The Line because of a wedding in the area. We did not book the “blocked” rooms because we wanted a king bed. We upgraded. Beautiful view of Griffith Observatory! Three things were positive: the friendly, efficient staff, the bed and the shower! Now, the negatives! No space in the room at all!! Our suitcases had to be on the desk, the table was glued pieces of wood at different heights so it had no use at all, and the chairs were awful, in my humble opinion! My husband whacked his head on the TV because you cannot even walk around the bed! The concrete walls were abhorrent to me. No softness or richness to the room.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"If you want to stay in a hotel that has a great party vibe and within walking distance to some great Asian food, this is the place for you! The room is very cool with lots of unique decor. The downside is the noise level from the street/second floor and some outlets and iron may not necessarily work. The room is a bit small and the blanket quality isn’t the nicest, but the hotel is a big party all day and night. The second floor has a nice restaurant next to the pool with a ping pong and foosball table. It’s a hotel that’s more geared towards young people who want to stay up most of the night.","Dear Jleung2213,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your recent stay.I am sorry to learn your experience did not quit meet your expectations.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,10,"Our family booked 3 Double Double rooms for 5 nights each. We liked the location and had high expectations based on some reviews and beautiful website. We all took a small vacation to attend a family wedding in Los Angeles. Pot Café and Commissary restaurants are not bad, even though they are a little overpriced. Location in Koreatown is not bad either if the idea is to explore Downtown, Hollywood and the usual touristic attractions.Nevertheless, we were surprised by several negative aspects:- Front desk service is snob and rude- The building is old and it seems renovation only happened for the looks- Acoustic and thermal insulations are horrible- Very low cleanliness standards (we found hairs on the bed and used contact lenses on the desk)- The bathroom is quite small and oddly has fabric and plastic curtains in the shower (again, cleanliness compromise)- Lighting is very dim all over the room, which is not very practical for make-up, for example- Breakfast is never included in the room rate (in our case, 220 USD per night per room — not cheap!)- The gym is small, equipment is ok but rather old (iPhone connector in the treadmills are iPhone 4) and AC works in one part of the room, while the other has the window open- This is clearly a party hotel. Every evening there is very loud music playing at the lobby — which can eventually be heard from the room. Rooms facing Wilshire Boulevard can be unbearable for light sleepers- Wi-fi is unstable inside the roomWhat astounds me is that some guests keep giving good reviews to this hotel. The Line Hotel seems to be spending too much energy on superficial things (decor, events, hype, etc.), charging a lot for it and forgetting about the most basic: hospitality, good service and comfort. Unfortunately our rooms were fully paid for, otherwise we wouldn’t hesitate changing hotels for the rest of our stay.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"I write this review disappointed because I had a high expectations of this hotel and personally chose it for my family and I.We had a late check in at around 9.30pm on a Wednesday. The guy who checked us in seemed disinterested and was more occupied offering his co-worker a donut rather than greeting us professionally and checking us in. He also failed to explain the hotels features to us properly and basically rushed to say “there’s a restaurant there’s a bar and a pool goodbye” after a long day travelling we just went to our room and called it a night. The rooms itself are on the small side , we had a booked a double queen room. They knew they had 3 guests staying but failed to provide 3 dressing gowns , enough toiletries and toilet paper. I mean these little things really do go a long way when you stay in a hotel and I noticed right away that they failed on small touches. The bathroom itself was not up to scratch , the sink was dirty and actually BLOCKED. The shower leaked on to the floor , all round my first impressions weren’t good. This continued on , I found every morning and we came out in to the lobby area the hotel front desk failed to raise a smile or even say good morning , they rather just stared blankly. I’m well traveled and haven’t been treated so coldly before , who knows why this happened!ANYWAYS my only positive this hotel would be its location, also we had a few drinks in the lobby bar and they were great , table service was served by a lovely lady. Bartenders were also friendly. We tried to have breakfast on our last Sunday morning but the commissary was closed.. the night before it was also closed due to a private event.Would I stay here again?

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"It was such a disappointment. From checking in and checking out. When I checked in at 5pm I was asked if I’ve stayed here before, probably should’ve said yes because I was given a joint room with the bed stationed in the middle of the room. The room was so small I barely had any space to put my carry on. While checking out, I was told I had a $25 credit for F&B, guessing they were too busy talking about BBQ chicken (I guess it was their employee meal) to let us know while we were checking in. The TV was literally four FT away from the bed, very uncomfortable to use. The curtains in the shower were cloth, so there’s a minor flood every time we showered. The funniest part is that the handle in the shower was broken, literally came off while I was turning on the shower. There were molds on the sink handles.The windows are horrible as well, it’s so thin, I can hear cars passing by and we were on the 7th floor.After we checked out, we tried to leave our stuff with the bellman, he literally ROLLED HIS EYES at us whenI told him we have 4 bags(2 carryons and 2 backpacks)2 stars for the three people that smiled at us for the whole visit or it would’ve been 0One housekeeperAnd the two ladies at the front desk while we were checking out.","Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your recent stay.I want to first apologize for the challenges you experienced with some of our team members.

So why didn't the hotel go that small, extra step and get rid of some of the actual shabby elements... for example, there were old funky fixtures in the bathroom - and the shower handle fell off the wall as I was turning it on! The windows must have been original to the old building and were drafty and allowed significant street noise to come in at all hours of the night.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"Stayed here one night on a Friday. Traffic getting there was tough but not the hotels fault. This is a trendy hotel. The room we had was extremely small and even though it had a King bed, was more appropriate for a single. Table was really cool like it was made out of blocks, but a disaster when we tried to eat at it in the morning. Also had little chairs more appropriate for a child. Food from room service was excellent. Shower had all the pressure you could want. Walls are a bare concrete, so again trendy, but a bit austere. One gripe is they do not have coffee in the room. You need to call room service.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"Stayed at the LINE for a few days on a business trip. The location and the hotel is probably the best option for the area. If you are looking to stay in the K-Town area, this is my number 1 choice. However, for it considered to be the 'Premier Luxury Hotel' in the area...it left me underwhelmed.I would say its a good hotel, but not a great hotel. The lighting is quite dim in the hallways.. not warm dim, but hospital light flickering dim. Also, the bathroom light busted while I stay. I requested it to be serviced, but no one ever came. Also, bathroom lights are already dim to begin with.A positive note is that, the beds are comfy and the views are amazing. The gym is minimal, but it does the job. Valet is quite expensive, so be prepared to spend for that. Also, for the amount you pay, you should get more than '1' box of water. They should include at least two complimentary plastic water bottles for this to be considered a 4+ hotel.Overall stay was great, but that was mainly contributed to the location. Service was subpar, I feel like they can improve on many things to really make this property stand out.","Thank you for taking the time to provide us with detailed feedback from your recent stay.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"We wanted to stay in Koreatown and The Line is in an excellent location, right in the heart of K-town. However, it's really loud - there was a private party the first night we stayed and it was as if we were staying in a nightclub, with loud thumping and people loudly talking and yelling while we were trying to sleep. It was kind of entertaining to see middle-aged Chinese ladies get down but I could still hear them even while wearing earplugs. We even had a ""quiet"" room facing away from Wilshire, but the nightclub was probably louder than the traffic.The decor is ""trendy"" meaning that they took an old 1960's hotel and stripped off all the wallpaper and carpet, leaving bare concrete and the popcorn ceiling.If you have a car, there are a few public garages nearby that are a lot cheaper than the hotel's $45 mandatory valet. While I enjoyed staying in Koreatown, I would not want to stay at The Line again.","Dear Allen,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your recent stay.I understand that your visit did not go as well as you expected.

I was on the 9th floor facing Wilshire and the nightime street noise kept me up all night. During the daytime, sun coming in the window even with the shade down was too much for the A/C to keep up with. I moved out after first night and stayed at the Indigo downtown which was 1000 times better.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"Can't argue with the location, which is right at the Wilshire-Normandie Metro stop -- you can get to downtown, Union Station, Santa Monica from here. Plenty of inexpensive eats within a short walking distance. But the king rooms are small -- I'm 5' tall and the room felt small to me. The bed takes up most of the space, with a large desk directly behind the bed (the desk doubles as a headboard) and a narrow area to maneuver the desk chair, a couple of lounging chairs and a useless ""coffee table"" (art, I suppose, but I could have used an actual unbroken surface instead of four irregular surfaces) to the side. There was an ornate gilt-framed mirror hung in front of the normal bathroom mirror, which diffused the light and made it difficult to read the ingredients in the bath products. (The soap contained nut oils, which I'm allergic to.) My room faced Wilshire and even though I was on the 8th floor the noise from the traffic was still pretty loud. And the decor is pretty industrial: exposed concrete and pipes, tarnished copper, unfinished surfaces. It's on-point now, but will be outdated in a year or so. Have to say, though, service was great -- they were having trouble with the key cards and they promptly dispatched someone to get me up to my room; I didn't have to wait. It's a roof over your head with clean sheets, but it didn't have much charm or warmth.","Dear Edward,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your recent stay.Although, we love and appreciate Sean Knibb's creative design for the hotel, we do understand his vision is not for everyone.I'm terrible sorry to hear about our bathroom amenities containing ingredients you are allergic to.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"This hotel just doesn’t work. First my hotel room was terribly noisy. I measured it with decibel meter & averaged 70.7 & hit 89! I️ called the front desk to inquire about another room, but was told I️ would have to pay for an upgrade. Surprising as 15 minutes earlier the desk asked what I️ wanted in a room. It’s like sleeping on an LA freeway amplified. Seriously bad! To make matters worse the electricity (ventilation) and wi-fi went out shortly after I️ arrived. Even when the electricity worked again, the room just couldn’t get cool - and it’s November! The decor just doesn’t work and cramps the room. My colleague burst out laughing when he came to my room- it is raw concrete, very small and as he said - “it’s like a prison cell!” Whoever thinks this is a “hipster” hotel is from Iowa. It is kitsch galore but certainly lacks utility or innovative design. No coffee pot or kettle, no luggage rack & minimal toiletries. It is Like a college kid designed it - a Freshman before his first trip to the city. They spent more space on snacks than a closet! As someone who travels a great deal it appears amateur and immature. If it weren’t for the truly lovely valets I️ would have given them 0 stars.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,10,"Positive things:- Good room isolation- Amazing views to Hollywood Hills.Negative things (where to start from...)- Reception: Not a very friendly staff. They made us wait for 50 minutes at our arrival because their credit card machine didn't work properly and, remember, this isn't Europe, you cannot access the room before they take a deposit from you, as if they presume you're going to break something. And if you arrive during the weekend, you'll have to yell at the receptionist, because music is too loud.- Lifts: they've got 3, but waiting time is far too long- Corridor: veeery noisy ice maker machine.- Bathroom: Bad quality amenities. They provide just one pair of slippers even if you are two.- Room: Not very big, but that's the minor issue. The major one you can see it very well looking at the pictures... Dirty carpet,2 long black hairs hanging out the shower courtain (yes, they have a unhygienic courtain in that cool hotel), dust everywhere and, oh god, a black curly short hair shining on my bed nightstand.

I left today and everything was exactly as dirty as three days before (not the little black hair, I took it away with a tissue, I felt revulsion having that next to my head).

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,10,"We ended up at the Line Hotel after losing a reservation at a hotel close-by due to our own error.We were interested in it because we were travelling as a family of four and wanted a room with two queen beds.The Line Hotel does appear very trendy. The walls in the rooms are unfinished concrete (although it's really unfinished concrete panelling). Beds face the large window that makes up one wall and the shades are controlled by a bedside button. This all seems pretty trendy.Where the arrangement falls over is that poolside there is loud music playing until late. The large window is not good sound insulation so street noise and loud music are about all that one can hear until after midnight.The rooms are chock full of snacks and drinks and mini-bar material as well as bizarre knick-nacks that clutter desktops, table-space and floor-space everywhere and that are for-sale. It's like having a Sky Mall inventory directly in the room. The dried cranberries and other snacks have a pungent smell that pervades the whole room.The A/C says that it has different fan speeds but really it's either high/too cold or off. We opted for off as the high fan speeds were really annoying.The bathroom for four guests is very small and cramped and it is not well ventilated. After a first bath it was steamy and stayed that way.In spite of the concrete-looking walls, the phone insulation between rooms was very poor. We were awakened at 4am by neighbours in the room next-door who were discussing quite loudly. I had to get up at 4am and bang on their door to get them to quiet down. They seem quite surprised to be bothering anyone. The faux-concrete walls seem to have tricked them.This hotel does not offer breakfast with the room rate.The valet parking guys were very good and helpful and talking with them was the best part of our stay.Overall, we slept poorly and did not enjoy this hotel experience.","Dear Alan P ,Thank you for taking the time to provide us with detailed feedback from your recent stay.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"Let me first start by saying that the location of The Line is perfect. In the heart of KoreaTown it's situated a very easy drive to most everything you'll want to see and get to; downtown, Hollywood, Beverly Hills, etc.The staff are very friendly and very willing to help with what ever you need. The parking is valet but with as much in and out as you want for one price per day.The rooms are clean and reasonable. Beds were comfortable and if you're facing north, the rooms have great views.The restaurant / bar on the second floor is cool, no doubt, and worth a visit.HOWEVER - the hotel amenities are expensive. The mini bar items are even more extortionate than you'd expect and included charges for items in the room including the ""Memento rock"" (see picture)There is no coffee maker or tea in the rooms (basically nothing ""free"") and the $7 coffee in the lobby is average at best.The clientele is a bizarre mix of the unabashedly hipster and Korean tourists. If that's not your scene, be warned. I lost count of the number of ironic hole ridden thrift store 80's jeans worn by the people around the pool in the evening.If you're looking for an upscale (or even slightly elevated) experience, keep looking.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,30,"I wanted to like this hotel more than I did. Price was right, it was meant to be a promotion connected to a convention I was attending though not sure if the price was really any different. The service was great, front desk staff were super friendly and helpful, and considering this is a super hip hotel that was welcome. The lobby area is clean and very modern, clearly in the evenings and weekends this place is a serious scene. Up to the rooms... the hallways felt a bit, how do I say this delicately... prison-like. The super modern design means everything is basically poured concrete which led to that ""I'm going to a cell"" vibe. The room was small but well appointed. We had a double and the beds were dangerously close to one another, so much so we ended up leaving the bathroom light on and the door half open for fear of banging toes/shins/knees when making a middle of the night run to the loo. The drain in our shower/tub didn't work properly so every 20 seconds or so, if you were showering, the plug would stop up and make all the water pool. We only stayed two nights so we sucked it up and I told the front desk at check out but still... I have a hard time believing that the cleaning staff never noticed this issue. Wifi was slow at times, but it worked and was free so again... not a major complaint. The location is great, right across from the metro if that's your thing and easy walking distance to all the glories of Koreatown eats. I'm not sure I would stay here again though, unless I was really focused on being in Ktown. Getting to the Staples center wasn't terrible but again, if I am going to deal with slow wifi, small rooms and crappy drains I'd rather have that and be steps away from where I'm spending most of my time.","Dear Holly C,Thank you for taking the time to share your detailed feedback from your recent stay.I want to first apologize for the challenges you experienced not only with your room but with the lack of customer service you encountered.

The LINE Hotel Los Angeles,20,"The Good: restaurant is lively and there is a good variety of interesting menu options. Finding the hotel is easy and the valet is fantastic. Check in was quick and friendly. There is a to go cafe and bar off the lobby. The lobby itself is very roomy with lots of tables/lounge space for meeting up with your group. Large floor to ceiling windows bring in lots of light to an otherwise dark room.The Bad: rooms are teeny tiny. Platform beds are super low. The bathroom lighting is horrible. Virtually no closet space. There are only 3 hangers in a ""closet"" that was max 10"" wide. Rooms on the street side are REALLY loud.The Ugly: while apparently intended to be an eclectic look, let's call it what it is...concrete walls that make you feel like your in a prison cell. If you can get past that, the space needs more warmth it feels very cold. The bathroom is aging and tight with terrible lighting. Took several tries to get my contacts in.Bottom line: it's a scene. Friday and Saturday nights draw a loud crowd. If that's your thing, then this is your spot. For me on business, I ended up leaving and finding a hotel with 24hr room service, spacious rooms and a bathroom that didn't need a pocket door.","Dear v'nes,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback from your recent stay.Although, we love and appreciate Sean Knibb's creative design for the hotel, we do understand his vision is not for everyone.I am happy to hear the staff made a positive impression on you and it is great to hear you enjoyed your time in Commissary.

The lobby is turned into a club on weekends, basically making it unavailable to hotel guests. Music is extremely loud and heard throughout the property. Went until 2AM on Friday and 4:30AM on Saturday. Finally got some sleep Sunday. Room was small and spartan like with concrete walls. Some non-functional furniture and supposed art work cluttered what room there was. There were no dressers or drawers for storage. Closet was very small with about a foot of space for hangers and another foot for three shelves. Plan on living out of your suitcase if staying more than a couple days. F&B very pricey.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport,10,"I chose Homewood Suites as an Honors member for the proximity to the airport. In their introduction, they invite guests to have more time to relax as they are 5 minutes from the airport terminals. As we had a 24 hour layover, and didn’t want to run around LA in the middle of Covid, we chose the hotel for its room size and small kitchen.We arrived at 12:30pm and were told it would be $60 to get into our room early. And they meant it. They didn’t let us in till 4 on the dot. No complimentary half hour early release into the room that probably was clean by noon. The lobby was empty and we sat watching stuff on our phones and reading, as we would have been doing in the room, so our choice, but considering how much we’d spent on the room in our loyalty program, I was surprised at the extremely subpar check in experience. (There were a few interactions- Internet access, getting a restroom key - that left me feeling more like a homeless interloper than a valued guest waiting to check in to her suite.)Then, to add insult to injury, when inquiring about the shuttle service to the airport so I could plan my morning, they have no schedule and instead of saving ones time so I could “spend less time in travel mode” as they promise on their website, they wanted me to come down an hour (!!!!!) before I wanted to be at the airport (2 hours before my flight). So, they get an epic fail at customer service and breaking the fundamental promise of why I chose this hotel (out of the dozens of choices) and I am making this promise to you, Hilton.I’m done staying in your hotels. Train your people to be kind and accommodating to their guests. Till then, I’ll check out some other hotels.","Jezeb31 - we appreciate your time in posting feedback about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear that you were not 100% satisfied with your stay.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport,30,"This hotel is your basic clean, convenient, airport hotel. There is a free airport shuttle that runs frequently. The lobby is inviting.

These items include;Ice cream bars, small tubs of ice cream,bottles of wine, beer, and other alcoholic beverages.Frozen dinners, and frozen snacks.A large assortment of drinks and bottled water.There is also an area of snacks and other items such as cereal so you can eat in your room. There is Dunkin Donuts onsite that has a happy hour glass of wine for $5.We were there during the Corona Virus lockdown so our stay was just for one night as we transited LAX. The hotel was taking different precautions at this time. We were not able to eat at the restaurant but take out was available with a very limited menu (one page). At this time, the pool is closed and social distancing is in place.We only had one complaint. At this time, they are not offering the advertised, included hot breakfast. We went downstairs in the morning expecting to get breakfast as nothing was communicated to us at check in. Instead we were offered a brown bag to go or 20% off the breakfast menu. The brown bag included a bottle of water, an apple, a plain bagel and an individual size pack of cream cheese. There was coffee to go. I decided to order the Steel Cut Oats for $15. It came with brown sugar and a small pack of granola. The oats were runny and pretty bad but my biggest complaint was that we were charged for them when they would have been included if the normal “Free Hot Breakfast” was still being offered.You may want to take that into consideration if having a free hot breakfast is a deal breaker for you when booking a hotel.

The hotel has limited or no security and rely on their front desk people to try and resolve noise and smoking issues.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport,20,"My mother and I booked this hotel for one night to break the journey from Hawaii back home. Finding the complimentary shuttle at LAX was a bit of a mission, but doable. Once the shuttle arrived, the driver was unable to help me load the bags, two of which were quite large and heavy. Now I had been lifting and handling both bags alone for the whole trip, as my mother has a bad back, but I’m not able to lift them to eye level and load them on a rack. Once we arrived to the hotel, check-in was smooth and easy. The hotel appears modern and new. We went up to our room, again me toting all the bags alone with no help offered. Once in the room we plan to order room service, and suddenly we hear BEEP. This continues roughly every 30 seconds (we figured the fire alarm battery was dying). We call down to the front desk and they re-roomed us at our request. They were quick and efficient. However, once in the new room, there was no room service menu to be found, and no extension given to dial. We attempted to call front desk and guest services for help, with no answer at either. We finally called the hotel’s main number from our phone, spoke with a very friendly man who seemed alarmed at our dilemma and patched us through to room service. The food arrived quickly, though a bit cold at that point. Regardless, we were starving and it tasted fine. The AC is the possibly the quietest I’ve ever encountered, which some may prefer. I personally like a little background noise instead of deafening silence. The room is well insulated, so we heard no airport noise. It seemed clean enough and the room itself is very impressive, with a kitchen and dining table, sitting area, and large comfortable beds. The complimentary breakfast was a bit of a joke. We attempted to toast bread three times and finally gave up and ate warm bread. The “hot water” for tea was in fact cold. The cereal was standard, and that’s basically what we ate. The shuttle was outside waiting when we walked out with our bags. This time the driver assisted with bags, but also alarmed us with news that it would take at least 45 minutes to get to our terminal (it took 5 mins the night prior). He set off and told us he’d use a shortcut to get us there faster. Basically he turned from terminal 1 to 7, bypassing the intermediate traffic (which seemed to be flowing along well), and dropped us at 7. We walked to terminal 5 (again, this was fine and we appreciated him). He told us to hop off quickly, so we grabbed our bags and hopped off the bus. As we walked away (me with hands full trying to navigate all the bags out of the road) he shouted at us for a tip, exclaiming “oh verrrrrry generous! Very generous!” in a sarcastic tone. I had been planning on turning around once my hands were free and bags out of the road to do just that, but once I heard those remarks, I simply grabbed my mother and began the long walk to terminal 5. This entire experience felt like a sham. They give you such a beautiful room, and then completely fail on basics of service. They can do better, and so can you.","katiepJ4907PZ - we appreciate your time in providing such a detailed review of your stay with us.

Homewood suites is actually one of my favorite properties. This location is very convenient to LAX, very well decorated, offers plenty of business amenites, and front desk and restaurant staff are very nice.However, the staff in the complimentary longe was unfriendly and this location dissapointed a bit with overall cleanliness. There were two non-working lights in the suite, the bathroom floors were not as clean as they could have been. I found hair on the hanging from the bottom of the bathtoom vanity. The caulking in the shower/tub was noticeably cracked. It left me feeling shall I say less enthusiatic about showering.The quality of the mattress for the sofa bed was extremely poor , even for a sofa bed.

I left for the afternoon and upon arrival in the evening, I noticed a bug on the floor. It ended up being a roach. What ""bugged"" me what I left my suite case open on the countertop (room had a small kitchen area). I grabbed a paper towel and killed the roach.I called the front desk and asked if they had a roach problem. The man advised no and that he's never heard of any issues. The agent answering didn't bother transferring to a night manager and honestly it didn't seem to bother him much. I wasn't going to make a big deal out of this but upon waking in the morning, I went back into the kitchen area (suitcase still open) and what do I see? Another roach. This time it was coming out of the coffee machine. I was disgusting having a pack of open candy 5 inches from the machine. I went to kill in and it went inside the machine. I went to grab my phone to record this (as I did the night before as well) to show the managers. I called down to the main floor and they advised they would change my room.But I leave this hotel with a few thoughts.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport,10,"I have never felt more unwelcomed at a hotel from my years of travel for both business or pleasure. I least expected this experience to come from a hotel chain run by the Hilton group.If you do not want to read the lengthy review here are the reasons why I gave this 1 star rating:1. Hotel appeared to be under-staffed and poorly trained2. There were no transparency and hotel staff were not forthcoming from the beginning3. Despite accepting our booking months ago, Homewood Suites decided to prioritize other guests without prior notice nor consultation with affected customers.4. There was no proactiveness to ‘make it right’ and compensation had to be negotiated and almost demanded.From our holiday in Florida, we were in transit via LA for a day on the 29th December 2019. My wife booked a 2 bedroom suite and a single bedroom suite for a one night stay through the hotel website back in April. In addition she requested for connecting suites as there were 6 of us travelling together. Upon check-in, we were told that our booking for the 2 bedroom suite was not available, the single bedroom suite was available but not ready until 4pm. The reception staff offered 2 connecting deluxe bedrooms instead which amounted to the same price as a 2 bedroom suite. The 2 bedroom suite came with a living room and a small kitchen, while the price for a 2 deluxe rooms may be the same we felt short changed as we were not getting the back same value. Throughout the check in process, the receptionist had to check with his shift manager, Eduardo Aguayo “Eddie”. I cannot recall if Eddie was busy at the time but we do not know the reasons why he did not come to the reception to manage the escalating tension, he was literally at another counter 5 feet away from the reception desk.Finally we were checked in and received the key cards for the 2 deluxe rooms. My father in law decided to walk over to Eddie to discuss the situation. Eddie then revealed that the hotel had decided to prioritize another booking from their ‘Diamond’ membership. While we understand that hotels may choose to prioritize guests, usually the hotel would have at least informed the guest and offered an amicable solution or offer to cancel the booking in advance. In this case, we had no alternative options but to stick with whatever Homewood Suites were offering after we showed up. After a period of negotiation asking if the hotel was planning to make it right, Eddie gave us 3 options; a small discount on the 2 deluxe rooms, a 3 course dinner for the 6 of us or Hilton Honors membership points. We accepted the 3 course dinner.When my wife and I finally checked in to our suite, we found that there were stains on our bedsheets, we informed housekeeping and they came promptly to change the sheets. After removing the dirty sheets, the housekeeper handed me the sheets and I was surprised and asked if we were supposed to do this ourselves? Moments later they came to make the bed for us.Dinner was at 6.30pm at the hotel’s Waypoint bar and Eddie told us drinks would be on our own account, but we decided to order and pay for the drinks anyway as a return gesture of goodwill. Eddie met us at 6.30pm and ushered us to the restaurant, the food was mediocre at best. With the exception of the buffalo wings, which were ok, the chicken noodle soup, the steak were super salty, as in seawater saltiness! All 3 courses were delivered around the same time, when we queried the waitress if this was the usual practice to deliver all the food at once, the reply was yes. Eventually the straw that broke the camel’s back was the final bill. We were expecting to be billed for the drinks plus tax and service, but on top of that we were billed for the tax and service for the entire dinner. When we queried Eddie that this contradicts the concept of a free meal, he brushed us off stating that the restaurant had the right to do that, much to our bewilderment!Perhaps it was our mistake to harbor unrealistically high expectations of Homewood Suites, however as part of the Hilton group we were expecting Homewood Suites to share the same values of the Hilton branding; IE H for hospitality, I for integrity both of which we did not experience first hand. Therefore either Homewood Suites follow different values or this could be a case of over promising, under delivering at best, misrepresentation at worst. Our flight was at 3pm but my family found the entire experience so distasteful that we decided to check out of the hotel an hour early and wait at the airport instead.Either way, thank you to Mr. Eduardo Aguayo for representing the Homewood Suites and the broader Hilton Group and single handedly ending our otherwise perfect holiday on a bitter note. NEVER AGAIN!P.S. If you are looking for alternative airport hotels at LAX, in future, I would consider Courtyard at the Marriot or Hyatt Regency both located just a block or 2 away from Homewood Suites and they offer complimentary airport shuttle as well.","887JohnW887 - thank you for your time in posting comments about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear of the issues you and your family faced.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport,10,"In April 2019, my family reserved a 2 bedroom suite for a 1 night stay at Homewood Suites on 29th December 2019. We paid extra for a suite which would have a kitchenette and a living room. But when we arrived on 29th December 2019, tired and jet lagged at the hotel at 3pm that day, we were told ON THE SPOT that the suite we booked was not available.Problem 1: How is it possible that there was no prior notice via email to let us know that the 2 bedroom suite was not available???We pressed for an answer about why the suite was not available. So Daniel (the front desk receptionist) went to ask Eduardo (the duty manager) for answers.Problem 2: Why doesn't the receptionist know the answer and has to run to the manager to ask for the answer to such a simple question???The Daniel came back with the answer that the room was ""out of service"". Then my sister asked him how many 2 bedroom suites are there in Homewood Suites, to which Daniel replied, ""1"".Problem 3: Daniel lied. My sister checked on Tripadvisor and found out that there are Homewood Suites has 5 two bedroom suites.So there we were, stuck at the hotel with our reservations cancelled just like that. Then we asked them what kind of rooms can we stay in? They offered us 2 deluxe rooms in H Hotel Curio Collection (the 2 hotels are somehow in the same building). And Daniel and Eddy told my parents that the 2 rooms would COST THE SAME AS A 2 BEDROOM SUITE.Problem 4: How is it possible that 2 deluxe rooms cost the same a a 2 bedroom suite that has A KITCHENETTE AND A LIVING ROOM???Problem 5: We reserved the 2 bedroom suite in April 2019. The rates would of course be cheaper than if we booked the 2 deluxe bedrooms ON THE SPOT at the hotel right??? And they even had the GALL to act like they were doing us a FAVOUR by offering us the same rates for the DELUXE ROOMS as we booked for a 2 BEDROOM SUITE!!!I honestly never felt so underestimated in my life. They tried to treat us like fools and hoped that we would fall for it hook, line and sinker. IS THAT HOW HILTON TREATS ITS GUESTS???So we had no choice but to accept and pay the same price for 2 deluxe rooms as we would have had for a 2 bedroom SUITE. Naturally we were unhappy and asked the duty manager, Eduardo, how we would be compensated, since Hilton BREACHED ITS CONTRACT when they CANCELLED the reservation without even bothering to inform us.Eduardo gave my parents 3 choices:1. Hilton points (after giving us such a bad impression, why we would want Hilton points is beyond us)2. Payment in cash for the price difference of the 2 rooms (which they claimed would be less that USD100)3. Dinner for 6 of usI immediately asked what dinner entailed and whether we could see the menu. So Eduardo got the menu for the in-house restaurant ‘Waypoint Kitchen and Bar’ and told us the hotel would pay for our MAIN COURSE.Problem 6: Somehow at Hilton, complimentary dinners are somewhat different from the rest of the world. I had complimentary dinners across Europe and Asia and so far, the ENTIRE MEAL is paid for by the host. Never have I heard of ONLY THE MAIN COURSE is complimentary.My mom reminded Eduardo that the hotel breached its contract with us, which is why they should be a bit more sincere in compensating us. Finally, Eduardo relented and agreed that the main course, appetiser and dessert would be complimentary, but we would be on our own for drinks. It still felt somewhat less than sincere but we accepted it. I then asked assertively for the name of the person who botched our reservation as I wanted to make a complaint about that person. Only after I directly confronted Eduardo, did he admit that the 2 bedroom suite we reserved had been taken by a HITLON DIAMOND guest. So apparently the guest “refused to move out”. So we had no room. Even though we made reservations since April. HOW IS THT EVEN POSSIBLE???Problem 7: Hilton apparently has no qualms about cancelling the reservations of guests who only have Hilton Honours and GIVING the room to their VIPs. Hilton non-VIPS, BEWARE. They can cancel your reservation without prior notice AT ALL.We went for dinner at the Waypoint Kitchen and Bar. The waitress told us that they only had 2 steaks left and they didn’t have the ingredients to make more. A RESTAURANT that is NOT a free for all buffet, RAN OUT OF INGREDIENTS???If that was not bad enough, we ordered the soup. It was so salty and lukewarm that we had to ask for hot water to DILUTE it. We ordered sautéed spinach. IT WAS TOO SALTY!!! Even the STEAKS were salty. How is that possible??? I can eat bacon straight, so my salt tolerance is considered pretty high. But the 3 dishes I named above were all salted like they were meant to be preserved!Problem 8: It started to feel like the chefs salted our food on purpose. If not, then the chef is so bad at cooking that he/she has no business in being in the culinary industry.Problem 9: Our soup, appetisers and main course all arrived in the span of 15 minutes. HOW IS THIS FINE DINING???We also ordered some alcoholic drinks with the intention to pay for it ourselves. And when the largely uneaten meal was over, we asked for the bill. We were expecting to pay around USD30-40 for the drinks. BUT we got a whooping USD93.03 bill. The SERVICE CHARGE WAS USD55.58.I got a shock and went to question the bill with the duty manager Eduardo. He was rude, condescending and tried to spoof me when he argued back with me, saying that we should expect to pay tips to the waitress as we are seasoned travellers and that he had to offset USD400 for our dinner.Problem 10: Eduardo was not upfront and forthright with us. He did not inform us that the drinks AND service charge would be paid on our own. IF he had informed us, we might have chosen other forms of compensation. Instead he condescendingly told us that we were being UNREASONABLE and that we should have EXPECTED to have to pay the service charge. Like I said earlier, I have had complimentary meals all over the world and not once did I have to PAY A SINGLE CENT for the meal.Problem 11: Eduardo lied and said he had to offset USD400 for our meal. I got the total bill of the meal from the restaurant. The total bill came up to USD391 including the service charge. My parents paid for the drinks and service charge in the end, so the total amount Eduardo would have had to offset would have been LESS THAN USD300.Hilton claims that the ‘H ‘ in their ‘HILTON’ core values stands for hospitality and the ‘I’ stands for integrity. We have yet to experience these core values in our stay at this ‘hotel’. In my experience, I saw and felt a total lack of honesty, integrity, forthrightness, hospitality, manners and ability to manage unhappy guests. If I could rate this hotel a ZERO, I would. As a seasoned traveller, I would say that this is THE WORST hotel stay I have ever had in my decades of travelling.","We appreciate your time in providing such detail about your recent experience with our hotel, and we're sorry to hear of the issues you faced during your stay.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport,10,"We booked a 2 bedroom suite on Hilton website for a night. We purposely booked the 2 bedroom with a kitchen & living room as more space. The booking was made in April for stay in December on Hilton's website - we booked directly to ensure we would get the room type.When we arrived at 3+pm, Daniel at front desk informed us that there was an issue with our room and if we could move to H Hotel next door but we would be given 2 standard rooms instead of a suite.We asked if there was any other 2 bedroom suites and was told the hotel only had 1 two bedroom suite - a quick check online told us that this is a lie - there are more than 1 two bedroom suites.After enquiring again, Eddie the front desk manager finally admitted that our room booking had been given to some diamond member.We were not given the option to have 2 one bedroom suites and the hotel charged us USD380+ for 2 standard hotel rooms at H Hotel - note that USD380+ was the price we booked for the 2 bedroom suite at Homewood Suites.We felt very cheated, the hotel overcharged us and did not give us the room that we booked for. They even claimed that the price we are paying for the rooms are cheap but when we checked online, no difference in price.At that point, Eddie offered us either a dinner on the house or a slight discount on the room.We accepted the dinner.Guess what? After dinner, an exorbitant bill came - USD$55.80 (18% service charge) by the restaurant.When we enquired, the waitress Lauren went to ask Eddie at front desk and he told her to charge us for it.So in effect, the meal was not free on the house.We feel cheated by this unscrupulous dishonest person trying to fleece more money from us. 18% service charge of USD55.80! 2 standard lousy hotel rooms instead of the 2 bedroom suite that we booked for the same price of USD380+.Do not recommend this hotel.","Aminswiss123 - we appreciate your time in providing feedback about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear of the issues you faced during your stay.

I mentioned this to the manager the next day and he had the nerve to get down on the floor, feel the spot, and proclaim ""well it's dry so I guess you didn't do it"". The reason I called the manager up in the first place is because I noticed that morning that my bathroom shower had not been fully cleaned. There was soap scum and hair in the shower when I checked in that I didn't notice until the morning. I asked them to clean this on my way to work, and when I came back mid-day AFTER maid service, it still had not been cleaned!

Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport,10,"I have been in the hospitality business for over 40 years and this hotel is very disappointing. I arrived at LAX after midnite and on the hotel website it says that their shuttle runs 24/7 at 20 minute intervals. I waited for 40 minutes and ended up walking the 1.2 miles to the hotel (with my luggage). On arrival I complained and the dest person offered me a $50 credit which was not on my bill when I checked out but they did, add it. The next morning I needed to return to the airport and asked when the next shuttle would be (after waiting about 8 minutes at the front door). They told me in about 20 minutes so I reminded them that their website says every 20 minutes. The reply was yes but the traffic was bad my response was that it is bad every day?? Anyway I walked again. That evening I returned to LAX at about 8:30 pm, same thing I walked again! So, if you want shuttle service, don't stay here! The room is very large but the bedsheet both days was not even tucked in (very strange way to make a bed but the top sheet did not fit the bed). The sink would not drain unless the plug was removed and then there was a bad smell. Towels are far from the shower so if you forget to bring one with you when you get it.......? Shampoo I used first day was not replaced. The second night I wanted to buy some ice cream from the 24/7 store in the lobby I asked someone where to pay and they said front desk but there was a line of 6 people and only one agent. I told the person in the lobby bar that i did not want to wait half an hour or more to buy ice cream. Their response was, ""so sorry for the inconvenience"". The staff at this hotel have a general, ""no can do attitude"". I would never consider staying here again.","anthony g - we appreciate your time in posting comments about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear that you were not 100% satisfied with your stay.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport,30,"Because this hotel was affiliated with Hilton, I assumed it was a Hilton hotel. I guess being in NZ, you don't get that many options - its either the Hilton or not. My expectation was that it would be a brilliant stay to end our trip. Unfortunately, it wasn't that great. Room was spacious and clean. Staff were friendly enough but it just wasn't what I was expecting. They weren't informative and I had to ask / prod to get information about the place etc. A small pool, no liquor license, no offer of assistance with our luggage, no late check out - only the standard 12noon. Breakfast was appalling. I was expecting an individually cooked meal on the spot for each diner. It was a buffet cooked for the masses! I would have been better off having breakfast at McDonalds. I mean seriously - no bacon???It's an average hotel - if you just want the basics - go for it. I certainly would.

The front desk staff was nice but we had done a online check in for a room away from the elevator. When we arrived after 4pm we were told our room wasnt ready but they would put us in a different room and it would also be away from the elevator. I believe it was the one of the closest rooms to the elevator (516). The view out the window was completely obstructed by the large metal sign on the side of the building. The hotel was one of the noisiest hotels I have stayed the doors didn't have any mechanism to slow them from slamming and every time someone next to us opened their door there was a VERY loud slam that followed.

It’s situated in a really good spot for the airport, and also for any trips outside of LA. I saw one review call the neighborhood “sketchy”, but I never felt unsafe. On the downside ( depending upon your needs & opinions)— the pool is weirdly located, outside the front door and adjacent to the road ( I’m Sure it’s the only space they had). Also the parking garage needs serious updating ( the elevators are scary, and the traffic patterns a bit wonky). Did not use onsite restaurant, so no opinion there.

Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport,30,"Beautiful new hotel, with great staff that actually care about the guests! The 1 bedroom suite is like a mini apartment, so will work well for longer stay corporate bookings.I have to say, it did not feel very cozy, slightly generic/sterile which seems to be what a lot of the new/renovated LAX hotels are now going for. The bed was hard, and the pillows a little blah (think more Hampton Inn over Hilton). Breakfast was terrible, did not return the next day for that slop.The AC was freezing, no inbetween. They need to workout the settings, for different times of the year.Kind of noisy (and Ive stayed at many LAX hotels) Did they forget the sound proofing?Keep in mind, this building is split in two, so only the lower 6 floors house the Homewood Suites (views are limited) The upper floors showcase the H Hotel, which looks more upscale and is usually the same price. Excellent views since those floors clear most buildings.I suspect they can work out the small issues, better breakfast, AC etc.Homewood Suites - Nice apartment, v spacious, works well for families and long term stays.H Hotel - More upscale, Upper floors.Parking tip: They charge $35 per day at the Joes Parking garage for in and out access. IF you do not need your car, just pay Joes directly online 24 hours prior and the rates are around $11-14 per day.A welcome new addition to LAX, can also walk to Terminal 1 in 5 mins.","1blokeCA - thank you for your time in providing feedback about your recent stay with us at the Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport.

A hotel by the airport you would expect some airplane noise but at-least they would have sound proofed the rooms better or the windows?The bathroom door was closed so when I opened it there was a pungent odor that permeated. It was not sewer but a chemical smell, very unpleasant.I left the bathroom fan run and went out with my associates for dinner. When I came back it was less noticeable.No less, my sleep was not pleasant because of the noise of LAX and the pillow comfort. The pillow are too soft for me and my head sinks way down in these.As a side and stomach sleeper these pillows will not do. Unfortunately, and like some other properties, there were no firmer pillows to choose from.Since they are newly remodeled the in house restaurant did not have a liquor license, yet.Searched on Yelp showed a few other properties nearby that had full service restaurants. We chose the Hyatt Hotel right next door. See my review on this fine dining.To make matters worse the breakfast in the Hilton Lodge was terrible. Only one choice of yogurt, it was slopped in a shallow tray. very unappealing. The hot entries were not appetizing .

Homewood Suites by Hilton Los Angeles International Airport,30,"Ok, the place is new and gorgeous and rooms are very spacious and nice. But they are clearly still trying to get it together a few months into business. I have filled out a couple of surveys and spoken to the staff nicely about my concerns. The front desk staff is nice, but they seem to have a lot of going on and don't seem to be able to multi-task or stop and focus on the guest. (I should add that I'm a frequent traveler for my job, and I'm a Hilton Honors Diamond member. No one at their front desk has ever thanked me for my loyalty as they do at most all other properties. This tells me it's probably a training issue.)I always have to wait on the valet... ALWAYS. (Maybe have more than one at this busy LAX property and help the poor employee out as well as provide better service???)The complimentary breakfast is consistently pretty bad. The fresh fruit is always like it's old. The bananas in the uncut basket this morning we're not even close to ripe and still had a lot of green on them. The scrambled eggs were barely warm and there's never any cheese or salsa or anything to even try to doctor them up. It is a very clean space though for sure. The attendant is right on it.The restaurant has a nice menu. Tonight my dinner was tasty, but the mashed potatoes were not warm. The chicken and the brussell sprouts were nice and hot, over top of room temp mashed potatoes. Hmmm... Not sure how that happens.Yesterday there was no wifi in the hotel, and today there is no cable. WTH??? The maid came in today as I got back from work tonight. I left the room at 6 am. Seriously!?!I'm over it.

Hotel Angeleno,10,"My home is a five minute walk from the Hotel Angeleno, on Sunday, July 21, 2019 I had a plumbing problem and needed a QUIET place to sleep. I walked to the hotel and (at 10:00 PM) and explained to the woman at the front desk what the situation was and that I needed a QUIET room so I get get a few hours sleep before checking out at 7:30 AM. I asked if there were any discounts she could offer due to how late it was (the hotel used to offer discounts for neighborhood people). No discounts were offered. So for $250.00, I was put in a room on the 15th floor over looking the freeway. Well I couldn't fall asleep, due to the ridiculous levels of noise from the 405 freeway, there is no sound insulation whatsoever it's like sleeping underneath a freeway overpass.Also the curtains in the rooms are cheap and sheer so all of the sunlight comes pouring into the room as soon as the sun is up. I spoke to Michael the Night Manager who was very rude and told me that I was welcome to leave the hotel (with no refund of course). Had I been told that I would be in a room over looking the 405 freeway, I would have walked to the LUXE HOTEL right next door, a much better place where you never ever hear the freeway and the staff takes excellent care of the hotel guests. In the future I will only recommend the LUXE HOTEL, it is far superior in every way.","Dear Projectguru4uThank you very much for reviewing our hotel.We have some guests that are sensitive to the freeway noise, so we suggest that they request a room on the other side of the hotel. Both sides have excellent views. It is just a matter of preference. As for the curtains, we have both sheers and black-out curtains in every room, so I will have to look at why sunlight would have come in your room.I hope the plumbing issue at your house has been remedied.Thanks again.Scott GordonHotel Manager",Trip type: Traveled solo,Date of stay: July 2019,"Response from Scott1111, Manager at Hotel Angeleno","Responded Aug 21, 2019"
Hotel Angeleno,10,"I stayed at this hotel for 5 days, I was getting good rates at different hotel sites. The staff that was there from the 28th to the 1st was very nice and friendly but then a new staff came and I could feel the vibe changed and I no longer wanted to spend my time and money there. Days after I checked out there was a BS unauthorized charges on my cc. They had no proof for the charge, they were clearly trying to make up the difference for the discounted rooms. I thought I was getting the hotel a great value just to deal with them taking money out of my account unauthorized. Do not stay there, do not trust them with your credit card","Dear Cellexu,Thank you very much for your positive comments about the hotel.

Hotel Angeleno,10,"Not worth it.During my stay for 10 days the following occurred:- It took 40 mins to check in, around 8pm in the evening, only one staff was helping guests- there was a line of about 5 other people waiting in line to be helped. The same is often true for most of the day/night, whenever you need something either at the desk or over the phone they are either overloaded with guests due to low staffing, or not picking up the calls because they are in the back (doing what? im not sure...)- Housekeeping did not always come on days requested, even when reminded throughout the day that they had still not arrived- Room service gave dated, soft fruit in the mornings(after spending $11/order), orders were wrong- a few times taking up to 3 hours to correct, or not arriving at all (and then not doing anything to compensate the orders after all that).This occurred every day, sometimes twice a day for about 8 days straight, after 8 days things got better, but still had problems. Even food was not eaten &incorrect they charged for the orders. Also charge for every item added/substituted to a meal & will only provide it on the side.- They charged $2 for hot water.- They spilled vinegar on my clothing items, fought about the fact that it occurred- completely denying responsibility, and then argued about paying to have them dry cleaned.- Internet was fully not functional, or hardly functional for about 5 days- Elevators were broken for 5 days, even after fixing it it broke after a dayand then a third time in the week. You'd think once they got it fixed it would actually stay operational. I was on a knee scooter, so the only working elevator was CONSTANTLY full of people to get to the lobby and I'd have to wait for 2-3 cycles of elevators just to get to and from my room because it would be packed with disgruntled guests who already had to wait 10 minutes for the first elevator to arrive- imagine how I felt...- The front desk and in room dining would NEVER pick up the phone for 10-30 minutes at a time or staff would put you on hold and never return to the line after 10-15 minutes of waiting, or theyd hang up on you mid sentence. On top of this, requests had to be made multiple times in order for them to follow through, and often something like a bell cart, and they only have 1 bell cart for the entire hotel.- They'd lie about ""losing keys"" to their cafe so that guests couldn't get snacks in the middle of the evening.- The hallways stunk of weed, people would wake you up with loud noise outside the room at 130, 230 & 330 am (etc.), I even had people doing the same at 6 am and heard vacuuming in one of the rooms above me as early as 545am. If you stay here, guaranteed you'll be awoken by loud noise during your stay and your clothes will reek of weed.- During my stay my sink plug wouldnt stay open, balcony door was impossible to open, toilet paper holder broken, shower handle was impossible to use -they were using alternate parts& waiting for parts to come in (leaving my water extremely hot or extremely cold),movie I rented kept skipping ahead/glitching, and the elevator was broken for about 5 days.- This is the kicker: My toilet broke and was spitting out water and maintenance said there was nothing they could do until the morning- I was given another key to a room beside me and was on a knee scooter going back and forth between rooms to do simple things like brush my teeth and use the toilet- I had to take all my toiletries back and forth between rooms. That morning, no one came and I had to call once again to get someone up there, housekeeping was also supposed to come first thing in the morning to clean up the spitting water and muddy maintenance people's shoes but I too had to request for this.-In all, no compensation was given(not even the bathroom), other than the dry cleaning.I have stayed at this hotel multiple times over 6 years&have normally been quite satisfied-even when they have gotten things wrong they normally correct it right away& they dont have mechanical/wifi issues- but lately even the staff dont care, and that reflects on management and the way the hotel is being run.During the last couple stays the hotel has definitely gone down hill, I'd no longer call this a ""luxury"" hotel, other than having a pool. I dont think it's worth the money. I'd probably suggest luxe next door if you stay nearby, you can often find it online for the same price and angeleno. They also have a better restaurant, &more expansive menu. Staff are way more attentive.Came to UCLA for surgery and I was shocked that staff actually made my life harder rather than easier and didn't even help me with the door when I entered and left the hotel. Some people/businesses never cease to amaze me in LA, the sad thing is that within a year, those poorly run companies go bankrupt and have to close down.","Dear pheir123,Thank you very much for your comments about the hotel.I apologize for the many issues you had with your stay here.

I had a neighbor check in very late who was so loud that she woke me up, and it took the hotel about an hour and several phone calls to finally move her (her lack of consideration was not their fault, but what occurred in the following hour was). And, upon checking out, my bill did not reflect the costs I'd discussed with the guy who checked me in.

Hotel Angeleno,20,I stayed in this hotel for three nights at the beginning of may 2019. On the outside it seemed nice. The rooms where Okay and of reasonable standard. But the noise from the busy freeway is awful. With the aid of earplugs I managed to block the noise out a bit.The sliding doors leading to the balcony do nothing in blocking the sound out. They claim to have one of the best roof top bars in L.A (not true) but they charge you for it with the price of drinks. Then there's the pointless valet service when it's just easy to drive 20 metres and park your car yourself. Of course you think it's free with the hotel booking. No of course not it's a lovely 34 dollars a night added to your bill. Then for extras added in to the small print there's the hidden resort fee and taxes. Which added an extra 150 dollars on to my 3 night stay. So I pre warn you about booking up this hotel with its over inflated opinion of its self.,Thank you very much for taking time in sharing your recent stay experience at Hotel Angeleno!We apologize to hear that your recent stay was less than flawless.We appreciate you sharing the challenges as this will assist us in making improvements.,Trip type: Traveled with friends,Date of stay: May 2019,"Response from MarionG2231, Front Office Manager at Hotel Angeleno","Responded May 13, 2019"
Hotel Angeleno,10,"Quick version: Worst hotel experience I've ever had.From the very beginning the hotel was a waste of too much money; as other reviewers are saying, the rooms are small, shabby, and loud. The carpets, once white and yellow, are now the kind of brown I'd expect at a Super 8. We ordered room service and were informed the menu was out of date but, no, they didn't have new ones, we would have to look online. Unfortunately, THAT didn't work either and we only managed to order a (frankly mediocre) dinner that WAS on the menu through an elaborate back and forth with the poor room service attendant. Then we were up most of the night because the walls were so thin we heard large portions of conversations through the walls, which was awkward. We then asked to change rooms this morning, but, no, we couldn't move all of our stuff down to the lobby because we travel with an emotional support animal (which they knew about ahead of time, we confirmed when we booked that this wouldn't be a problem) at which point we were told that we ""weren't getting kicked out, but [we] could not stay."" Marian Angelos was upbeat and chipper while kicking us to the curb and telling us we wouldn't get a refund, which was a shame because otherwise we would have gladly stayed our entire week and a half without leaving a review like this, despite the other subpar elements. So, if you travel with an emotional support animal or pet of any kind, beware of this place, but no matter who you are, do yourself a favor--if you're booking in LA, DO NOT GO HERE! There is no shortage of acceptable, even lovely, hotels in this city who will treat you better than this.I've NEVER had an experience this negative at a hotel ever before in my life. We are quiet, our cat is trained and registered, and we are clean. I have it on record [video of Marian Angelos herself] that when we left, the room was in perfect condition and there were no complaints. There was no trouble at check-in and we were summarily evicted.","Thank you very much for taking time in sharing your recent stay experience at Hotel Angeleno!We apologize that your stay was less than flawless :(Per the incident with your emotional support cat, we sincerely apologize about that as we allow only service animals and per Americans with Disability Act, Emotional Support Animals are not considered as Service Animals.

Hotel Angeleno,30,"Check in staff was not the friendliest nor most helpful. It was a quick 1 minute check in and I felt that some information was run through too quickly or not even mentioned at all. E.g. no mention of my room being upgraded, no information regarding breakfast and no mention of the deposit held on my credit card.I requested a room on a higher floor, as I knew the hotel was right by the freeway so it would be noisy. We were assigned a room on level 15, which we appreciated along with a complimentary half bottle of pinoir (honeymoon). We were later made aware that we had been upgraded to a ‘killer view’ room. Thanks Hotel Angeleno, although to be honest the view was not a killer view at all - it was overlooking apartments, car park and freeway.The noise levels were quite ridiculous. The sliding doors opening to balcony were not properly sealed/ill fitting - you could hear road noise coming in through the top of the doors. There was also a consistent loud noise coming from the hallway and cold draught coming from the large gap on the bottom of the room door.The room in general was fairly clean, however the bathroom was a bit grim. There were smear marks on mirrors, dirt marks on light switches and streaks/stains on wallpaper.We asked if we could self park instead of valet, the response we got was ‘you can park on the road’.

Hotel Angeleno,10,Had a terrible time at this 3 star hotel for an event / wedding room block. Reception staff has no clue what was going on and looked puzzled when I arrived and didn’t know whether my parking was complimentary or not and had to ask a supervisor. I blocked out 28 rooms which is roughly 2 floors as well as renting out an event space at the top floor next to the restaurant. I expect for the size of the event that the staff know what’s going on and be courteous to all the guests that are attending. However this was not the case. There was no communication at all between higher level management/sales/event planner with the reception desk at the front as well as the valet service. A lot of things were delayed due to the confusion and havoc that occurred because of the valet parking staff. They would not let my guests attend the event unless they paid up front even though parking is complimentary. The delay of course costed a lot of time which delayed photography at my wedding ceremony and reception site at the skirball cultural center. We weren’t able to get any night photos outside due to the delay in the morning at hotel Angeleno. And extending hours for photography are a huge cost at wedding events since we hired the best.

Hotel Angeleno,30,The front desk staff is everywhere. Half the time you stood at the front desk and no one was there. We arrived and they made us Valet our car - $34 a day - they do not tell you this! We didn't find out until the last day. They said they have a underground lot but never told us where the entrance was. The rooms are very small - and note the hotel is right NEXT TO THE FREEWAY. You hear the cars and traffic no matter what. As i mentioned the rooms are quite small which means they are right next to each other (there was about a foot between our door and the neighbors) so you cna have your do not disturb up but it won't do you any good - slamming of doors vacuuming of hallway into your door etc. One point is - they tip their employees so you don't have to - thank goodness. But they will complain about it. I recommend this hotel for 1-2 night stay but nothing longer.,"Hi,thank you for your review.We only offer valet parking.

Hotel Angeleno,10,"I stayed at Hotel Angeleno during a recent business trip and was hoping for the boutique, trendy hotel that their website and reviews promised. Instead what I got was one of the worst hotel stays that I have experienced. I arrived later in the evening as was told the only room was on the second floor, no big deal except that the room faced the highway. Between the traffic noise and the air conditioner noise, it was so loud that I could hardly hear the TV. The room was poorly stocked with only one towel and no toiletries. Many things were run down and broken.The next morning I took the arranged hotel shuttle to my conference and began to feel bites all over my feet. Upon looking down there were swarms of ants all over the shuttle, and unfortunately, my legs. They took care of the ant problem, however, throughout my stay the drivers were super rude. I tried to order room service, however, there was no menu in my room other than one on their TV. I was quickly informed that it was out of date when I was given some pretty significant attitude when I called to order something that was no longer available. I tried to go to their lobby cafe but it was randomly closed.The next morning, while taking a shower, the power in the entire building went out... I guess I should be thankful I was only on the 2nd floor.Overall, I guess it is nice it was close to UCLA and the sheets were clean but I certainly would never stay here again given the rude service and the series of unfortunate events","Hi Kathleen,thank you for sharinf your feedback with us.I would like to thank you for choosing Hotel Angeleno.I apologize for the areas of your stay that were less than satisfactory.

Hotel Angeleno,20,"This hotel is in a very convenient location and the views from the bar/restaurant are amazing. Comfortable beds and good use of small rooms. They have a ""Skip the Tip"" policy...not a fan; their prices are jacked to a ridiculous level. I wouldn't have tipped anyone in the restaurant as the service was abysmal. Breakfast was included in a Travelzoo package (supposed $21 value). I don't think I've ever experienced worse food or service anywhere ever. Though other items on the menu were available at that price, you get the garbage plate: yesterday's potatoes and eggs, toast that isn't very toasted and has no butter or jam or anything to put on it, and chicken sausage fried until it was black and so tough you couldn't cut it with a knife. I literally could not eat anything on the plate. The cups on the table setting were filthy (wash the foam from the lattes off for crying out loud!) and we pointed this out to the waiter...who promptly returned with a pot of coffee and poured into the dirty cups. We got one cup of bad coffee ($6 for a cup of coffee?!) and no one returned to the table except to bring the horrible food. So everything positive was negated by this and I would not recommend this hotel and will not be returning. BTW, Travelzoo contacted me immediately and even sent me a $25 gift card.

Hotel Angeleno,30,"First off I would say the best thing this Hotel has going for it is the location, very handy to the San Diego Freeway and a stones throw from Beverly Hills, U.C.L.A and Brentwood.I'm going to base my review purely on value for money so this is where it goes downhill rapidly.It's a circular hotel for a start but I had paid approx $282 a night for a room to sleep 4 people, basicaly all we could do was sleep in the room as there was no room for our suitcases or clothes, forget about living space unless you lie on the bed.The offer they gave us was $25 off a meal in the restaurant, we though this was daily but found out it was a one off, (for a family of 4 in a $282 a night room).The Hotel itself looked decidedly ""lived in"" and the sink in the room appeared to be blocked as it took a lifetime draining.We left the cases with the consierge expecting to have them brought to the room but after 1/2 hr went back to the lobby to find them still lying there on the trolley.On check out they tried to charge us for Valet parking on the bill at some $160 only I had checked the booking and we had booked before they had introduced this tourist tax so was readjusted to support this fact.The best way to sum this Hotel up is you pay more you expect more and sadly we didn't get more.","Hi Nickwot,thank you for taking the time to share your feedback with us.I'm sorry to hear you were not happy with your room size.We do offer suites, which include a separate living room space.We recently made changes to our parking policy, and there is a daily charge for parking on reservation made after a specific date, I apologize if there was an issue with the parking charges, but I'm glad to hear it was resolved.Please let me know if there is anything else i can do for you.Thanks,Vicky EscalanteMarketing Managervescalante@hotelangeleno.com",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: April 2017,"Response from Vicky E, Manager at Hotel Angeleno","Responded May 18, 2017"

Hotel Angeleno,10,"I stayed here because it was recommended by a wedding party. However, it was a big mistake. Even with the ""special rate"" they had secured, it was expensive. The hotel is right next to a highway so it was very noisy even though we were on a high floor. There was a built in unit that had a closet and drawers and desk. So the closet and drawers were very small and inadequate for our clothes. There was very low water pressure in the shower. There were only two elevators for the entire hotel, so many times we had to wait quite a while for an elevator to go up or down.

The doors do not seal to the hallways either, so expect to hear other guests talking and if you are near it you will hear the elevator. because of the unique shape, the hotel rooms are probably the smallest i have stayed in, with definitely the smallest bathrooms possible. Beds are very comfortable, some of the best i have used, without that i may have not slept at all, even with earplugs. I usually mask any noise in most hotels by running the bath fan and ac fan at full during the night but there was not a bath fan and the ac fan had a mind of its own and turned on and off throughout the night regardless of settings. The pool is nice but not warm in comparison to most and there is no hot tub. They have a nice small outdoor fireplace that is on in the evenings. the gym is small but looks over the pool and have quality treadmills and ellipticals.The restaurant/lounge on the top floor is a gem and reminds me of a vintage elite country club with a great view.I love the tip free atmosphere.the complimentary valet service is probably normally a nice touch, but record rains and below average temps during our visit made for uncomfortable waits(it would have been nice to just go get our own car when we wanted to).all in all, if you are a sound sleeper and only traveling by yourself or as a couple you will probably like this place, otherwise i suggest doing as i will and shop around further.","Hi,Thank you for your feedback.We apologize for the noise from the freeway.Due to our location we go above and beyond to eliminate any noise.We have double paned Windows to help with the noise, we understand if some guests are more sensitive to the noise and we can help by offering different rooms.You can set the A/C to run all night long, or you can set it to turn off after a certain temperature - our front desk is open 24/7 and happy to help guests with A/C settings.We offer complimentary daily Valet Parking to make our guest experience as pleasant as possible, but we'll review your feedback, as we understand and respect that not all customers have the same needs.We're sad to hear you won't be staying at Hotel Angeleno again, but I'm glad you enjoyed our restaurant.

Hotel Angeleno,30,"Spent one night at the Angeleno. It's an interesting circular structure that seems to have been recently renovated; the floor I was on had very fresh and clean rooms with a pleasant modern decor and comfy beds. Staff was friendly and check-in service was quick (much appreciated by tired business traveler arriving late in the evening).There are two things that prevent me from giving this place a top rating:1. Major problem: location; while it's close to the UCLA campus, it's also right next to a major highway. If you land a room facing the highway, prepare to sleep with earplugs. It is NOISY, even on the upper floors (my room was on the 12th floor). Rooms facing away from the highway may be quieter but I cannot tell.2. Minor: they overdid the ""modern"" in the renovation. I am technically savvy but it still took me a good 10 minutes to figure out the strange touchpad contraption used to raise and lower the blinds. As best as I can tell, you need to slide your finger up or down on the left to open the blind, and on the right to raise or close the sheer drape. Some instructions would have been appreciated. Or, better yet, replace this infuriating device with a regular up/down rocker switch.","HiThank you for your review.We apologize for the noise from the freeway.Due to our location we go above and beyond to eliminate any noise.We have double paned Windows to help with the noise, we understand if some guests are more sensitive to the noise and we can help by offering different rooms.Also, thank you for your feedback on the touchpad blinds-we'll look into including some instructions for our guests.We really do hope to see you again soon.Thank you and have a beautiful day.Hotel Angeleno",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: February 2017,"Response from Vicky E, Manager at Hotel Angeleno","Responded Feb 28, 2017"
Hotel Angeleno,30,"We chose this hotel on the bases of the reviews and its proximity to the Getty Center which we wanted to visit. The rooms are very nice but be prepared for freeway noise 24/7 since the hotel is right by a major freeway and access and exits. You will hear the roar of cars and the occasional vehicle gunning its engines. There seemed to be a problem with maintenance as one of two elevators wasn't working which caused major delays getting down to the lobby and up to the restaurant, and the metal frame for our floor to ceiling window fell off our first night and was not installed by the second. The shuttle dropped us off at the Getty Center but failed to pick us up at the agreed-upon time. We understand when we phoned that the driver was sick, but it would have been nice to have a courtesy call to tell us to find our own transportation.We hate to give such a critical review because the staff was generally very nice and the daily wine receptions were a neat way of meeting other guests, but there were some major problems with the hotel.","Hello Calif0rniadreamers,Thank you for your review of the Hotel Angeleno.

Hotel Angeleno,30,"Good News: Decent room rates, AAA discount, can cancel up the 24 hours before check in. We were give breakfast for two, for two mornings.Bad News (on this stay): Hotel is 16 floors. After we got our room on the 9th floor, we were informed only one elevator was working. Long wait times for elevator.Bigger issue is that this is now a ""No Tipping Hotel"". The concept just does not work in the service industry, especially at this hotel property.Let me give you an example: first morning went to the lobby in the morning to get a cup of coffee. I was told to go to the restaurant on the top floor. The next morning I went to the restaurant on the top floor and was told I had to go to the lobby for coffee. Mind you there is a huge wait for the elevator and the restaurant on the top floor had coffee, just made me go down stairs??, presumably so they would not be bothered serving without receiving a tip. Last day at check out we called for someone to assist us with luggage, after 20 minutes we took our bags down ourselves, front desk said bellman could not get to our room.. sorry.","Hello Social_tourist,Thank you for your review of the Hotel Angeleno, we are happy to hear that you enjoyed our room rates, AAA discounts, cancelation policies and our wonderful breakfast.

The staff was extremely friendly :) and the location was good as close to the hospital (6minutes uber ride). The bed is very comfortable. The rooms are quite trendy although still have old carpet which I'm not a fan of..On a different note, the renovation is not completely done, the bath is old and not very white.. There was a hair in the shower and the sheets were upside down...?

Hotel Angeleno,30,"Remember this hotel as the former Holiday Inn from the 70s. At some point it was redone & renamed Angeleno. The location is conveniently located off 405 FWY near UCLA, The Getty Center, Skirball Center and the Westside. This is not a lux hotel but you probably can't find any other hotels nearby at a better price. The lobby is small but clean. There's a snack bar that sells salads & sandwiches. We got munchies to go with the free pours of wines they offer at lobby happy hr. There is a small pool and gym behind the lobby with easy lounge chairs & a fire place for informal gatherings. The room we had was smartly furnished with a view of the freeway & greater LA. Not bad! We didn't hear much traffic noise even though 405 is always busy but we are not light sleepers. The only thing we didn't like was the mandatory (complementary) valet parking, as every in and out mean more ""tipping"". And watch out for after-school and rush hour traffic at the intersections of 405/Sunset/Church lane. You can get caught in the jams trying to access the hotel driveway. We'd stay here again if we need to be in the neighborhood!","Thank you for staying with us. We value our guest experiences and enjoy the feedback. Our hotel is actually a skip the tip property.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,30,"We rented a room at BLVD for a night as part of a day trip to L.A. from our vacation in San Diego. Overall, we were pleased with the room - clean, modern, the bed was comfortable and slept well. Check-in was easy and the location was great. Our one BIG complaint was the lack of hot water. My boyfriend and I stayed in the room, and I took a shower first. About six minutes into my shower, I noticed the water starting to get cooler, so I turned the knob to make the shower a little hotter. My shower lasted about 11 minutes, and after about ten minutes, and two bump ups on the water temperature, there was no more hot water and I had it on as hot as it would go. My boyfriend got in the shower about 10 minutes after me, and he had NO hot water. Needless to say, he was NOT happy.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,10,"Now firstly let me start with the location of the hotel - within walking distance of Universal City and just a short drive to desirable locations such as the Hollywood Walk of Fame and Beverley Hills. With a spacious (if not slightly expensive) car park, geographically speaking this hotel is ideal. Whilst there isn’t a huge amount in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, most who travel to L.A do so with a car so this isn’t a huge issue.On our first evening at the hotel, with not a great deal in the immediate vicinity I suggested to my partner we go down to the main bar for a drink. We’d spent the day driving down from San Francisco so certainly felt like we needed something to take the edge off.On reaching the hotel bar, the atmosphere wasn’t exactly what I was expecting. Otherwise empty there was a small group of locals congregating at the bar playing music through an ipod docking station. Not adverse to some background music whilst enjoying a cold pint, I have to say the volume was absolutely unbearable and more in keeping with a night club. Myself (and everyone else who subsequently entered the bar) didn’t hang around for long.Regrettably, I had to pop down to reception a couple of hours later, and neither the scene nor ambience had improved. The small group of four had increased to circa 20 people along with a further rise in decibels from the chavvy music system still in operation. Staff at the hotel even went to the trouble of inserted a temporary curtain partition in order to separate the increasingly boisterous bar from the check in area.To my amazement when I mentioned the previous nights events the following morning, I was informed that the instigators of this inappropriate behaviour was none other than the hotel OWNERS! Apparently this is an all too familiar occurrence (I can vouch for that as it happened again two nights later)Incidentally, on arrival on that first noisy night I witnessed one of the hotel owners rudely throwing their car keys at one of the hotel staff members telling them to “go and park my car”. At the time I thought it was a customer but on discovering it was the owner I was absolutely disgusted that anyone would treat an employee in this way.The young owners of this hotel need to take a seriously long look at themselves and grow up. As a business and they need to start treating it like one - it should never be a social haven for them and their friends to party into the early hours. Particularly when on two out of four nights we were at the hotel, it was clearly at the detriment of paying customers.If I was basing my rating on the attentive and diligent staff members at this hotel it would be 5 stars. Sadly they have been seriously let down by their management team and the owners of this hotel.Time to grow up gentlemen!",Thank you for staying with us.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,20,"There are no medium points on the different categories in my opinion. will start first with the Pros and what I liked, then, the cons or bad things....What I liked:- Very close to Universal studios, walking distance, very comfortable if that's the plan of the stay.- The installations and rooms were the best I saw during my vacations in the different cities and hotels I visited.What I DID NOT LIKE;- When we arrived, we were given a room, then I walked with my family, wife and two children, opened the door... there was a couple in underwear in the room.... we were given an occupied room...!!!!!!!!!! that was very embarrasing!!!!We went back and claimed it, we were given another room, but in my opinion the hostess attitude was without any interest in the issue, she blamed the computer... computers don't make mistakes... people does....- The next the morning 5 AM I received an SMS text alert from the bank, I was charged with $340 US DLS from the hotel.... I HAD PRE PAID MY ROOM!!!! Again, I had to go to the front desk to ask an explanation..... again, the front desk blamed the page XXXXX.com I used to reserve, but I clearly saw in my phone the charge to my credit card from THE BLVD HOTEL & SPA... He said that would talk with the supervisor to refund me the spent. If I don't claim, then I wouldn't receive back my money and that's not the point!!!The first step to fix things is to face the error and act to correct it!!!- When I saw the advertising for the hotel it does not clearly shows total costs..... There is a charge of $31 USD PER DAY (I was two days) for parking in the hotel which is ridiculous and an extra fee of 5.75% for employees compensation per day (or tip???)... those are hidden costs that if I would be asked, I wouldn't paid after my experiences...I reported the wrong keys issue to the supervisor in charge, she heard me, but I just received an ok as answer... I'm not sure how seriously took it, I don't expect a written report of it, but I don't feel confident the company is committed to deliver an extraordinary experience...At the end, I the supervisor told me the wrong charges to my card were reversed but it take days to show back in my account, I expect it to happen...On the other hand, I see a lot of potential in the installation, but I also see a huge opportunity for improvement in the Human Resource...For now I don't recommend staying here or at least I will not be back after this......","Thank you for staying with us.

I will say I would have preferred one of the hotels connected by bridges. It’d be worth the extra $40 not to walk through downtown LA. I’m writing this review at 2 am. I was awoken by a lady legit screaming for her life outside. It sounded like she was being stabbed or punched. Then there was yelling and loud talking that echoed in the halls no doubt from people also awoken by the screams outside. Halls are very noisy and echo. Doors slam loudly. Hotel theme colors are VERY dated. Bright orange and other bright colors that look very warn. And the cherry on top, “pool” is in the parking garage....... I’m serious..... you have to walk through the parking garage. It’s about the size of a car. Hell to the NO if I’d ever let my kids swim out there even if they wanted to.One positive, free happy hour was nice.","Thank you for staying with us pmama.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,30,"$31 per night parking charge with no on street or other options spoil this otherwise comfy and fairly convenient hotels location to Universal Studio's. Room is generous and easily can handle a longer term stay of a week. Separate sitting room has fridge, micro wave, sofa and a real working desk. Unfortunately, WI-FI is very spotty and we used our personal hot spot most of the time. Two TV's, one is in bedroom pod and one in sitting room make for a nice combination.Lobby has a nice bar and a 24 hour handy pre packaged sandwich shop.Eateries abound within walking distance but neighbourhood can be a bit sketchy so we drove. 101 Freeway across the street so ask for a room on the opposite side.Bathroom is large for a hotel and well thought out. Only problem is hot water in short supply. Warm is the average ""hot"" setting.We had a bath maintenance issue that was promptly addressed.Desk staff runs from very friendly and helpful to surly (one individual).If you are here to visit Universal a better option would be the on site Sheraton or Hilton, but for a somewhat funky experience that gets the job done BLVD is fine, but nowhere near great.",Thank you for staying with us JohnnyGWestport_CT.

There is a Ralph's supermarket not too far away but I have to say there are not many restaurants within walking distance. We have been catching the metro to Hollywood Highland or to Universal studio walk for dinner. Room is spacious and comfortable. A few points to note though;- housekeeping is not the best - we had one bar of soap for our 4 nights stays and shampoo and conditioner were not replenished one day- the rollaway bed we had for our son continues to make squeeky noise at night whenever he turns- we only had 2 bath towels one day when it's very obvious that we have 3 people in the room (with paid additional rollaway bed)- free drink at happy hour but only on beer or wine... would not offer soda which should cost the hotel less- reception staff never greet guests and avoid eye contacts (other than the lady working on morning of 10 Dec 18).

Blvd Hotel & Spa,20,"Booked this hotel for a surprise to for my girlfriend to Universal Studios. BLVD is touted as a ""spa experience"" Hotel. You're better off just booking a different place. Firstly, you'll get hit with a $31 parking spot. That's not a huge deal (it's LA after all). We checked in super late in the evening and went up to the room, which was really spacious and modern looking. When we checked the bed. The left side was caved in. There was a huge divot in the mattress and that same side creaked like crazy. I called the front desk to see if someone could fix it or we could switch rooms (since I saw people checking out as we checked in). Our response was ""we don't have any maintenance people and we're completely full."" That was it. The woman at the front desk might as well have said ""suck it up."" She didn't offer any help. All night long, I was tossing and turning because I was sleeping in the crater on my side of the mattress. every time I moved, it woke up my girlfriend because the bed creaked like crazy. The next day we were exhausted walking around Universal Studios.If you've booked a trip to Universal Studios, do you really want to risk ruining the entire vacation because you booked a room with a broken bet and poor service?You can probably find a cheaper room with better service.I added one star because the shower was amazing.","Thank you for sharing your feedback with us at The BLVD hotel.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,30,"BLVD's staff was very friendly and helpful (especially Michael and Rebecca!) and our room was clean and comfortable. My only criticisms are of the management, who seem resistant to the fact they're running a family hotel. To the Management: You are operating an affordable hotel 3 blocks from a major theme park. That makes you a family hotel. Accept it...it's a good thing! The lobby features a large bar - which was empty whenever I saw it - but only a tiny snack bar for food with no place to sit down and eat. I'd recommend offering free breakfasts and space to eat them, adding a small shop for necessities (sunscreen, diapers, stamps, etc.) and a laundry room, installing higher watt bulbs in rooms and bathroom (they're really dim), losing the complicated showed fixtures, and making nice with the bank (so they fix your ATM in less than 3 days). Finally, take a look at your ""art"" - all the pictures that feature people only showed white people. C'mon.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,30,"Rooms are clean, bed was decent. Interesting shower heads, one handheld head and the other a rain simulation head, difficult to figure out when turning on and selecting which one though. Parking is $31.00, which I thought was provided, need to leave keys with the front as they play ""musical chairs"" in shuffling cars around in garage and your car will most definitely be a moved by them at least a few times a day, not sure what I think about that...hassle if you're in a hurry or want to grab something out of the car quickly. Cute front lobby, connected to their mini lounge which offers complimentary beer or wine for a couple hours nightly...i believe there is a limit (can not recall as I did not partake this time). Toiletries are included such as shampoo/conditioner, lotion, shower cap, sewing kit and I believe even shoe polish which was nice, as is iron/ironing board. The huge bummer was the pool. Entrance is through parking garage as it is attached to that, very small and in major need up upkeep and maintenance. It was highly chlorinated, however still had murky, green appearance, my kids did not even want to get in and questioned cleanliness. Had to request towels from housekeeping as the bin was empty where they stuck them. Also of note, the front desk member needed to get the key, room key does not work, and let us in which was another few minutes to even get inside...they should just get rid of it all together or remodel.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,20,"We just got back from staying at this hotel and was pretty disappointed. We chose this hotel based on the location as we visited Universal Studios. The price was ok, a little expensive but I get it based on the location and the time of year. The “lobby” is literally right in front of the entrance and the main elevator to the rooms so super awkward location. They did offer 1 complimentary drink at the bar during happy hour which was nice. The room was pretty spacious and beds were fairly comfortable but the furniture/paint/bathrooms are a bit outdated. The first morning, I noticed we had zero bath towels in our bathroom...really? When I called for some towels I was told it would be 30 mins. I asked if I could just come down to get them, so I had to get dressed and go down to the front desk to pick up my own bath towels. Once I got there, the employee didn’t say a word, no apologies or anything. Our shower drain cover came off and my foot almost went right through the drain. There were also printed instructions on how to use the shower taped to the wall...a bit tacky. If you have to have instructions on how to use the shower, maybe it’s too complicated..? $31 for parking which is pretty standard but the process is a bit ridiculous, they make you park by pulling all the way forward in the spot allowing others to park behind you. How do you get in and out easily throughout your stay? And if you don’t pull all the way forward, you get charged double...?I know that marijuana is legal in California but I hated seeing shuttle drivers parked in front of the hotel sitting in the passenger seat smoking a joint as I walk my 11 year old daughter by, a bit unnerving.The hotel did the job and was a place for us to sleep but that was it.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,20,"I did not like this hotel.Maybe my standards are a bit high, but even in trying to be reasonable...I did not like this hotel.We stayed here because we were in town for a family event and needed to be close to family and event locations. So, tried booking online, through multiple sites. No less than $600 a night on any website. So I went to the hotel's website - $400 a night. Called them up and asked about the disparity - quoted $240 per night. Husband called back twenty minutes later - $199 per night. Quite a range of prices for a hotel on a relatively isolated block on Ventura, directly across from the freeway.Don't stay here with kids, despite its proximity to Universal Studios. No bathtub. Sink was too high for my kid to reach it for tooth brushing or hand washing, so we had to drag an ottoman into the bathroom for her to stand on. Don't think you'll be comfortable in the bathroom, either. Weird design of the sink meant I was covered in water while even washing my face. Weird double shower heads combined to create half the water that one should put out. Hotel reeked of pot throughout our five night stay. Yes, weed is legal in CA, and no, I typically don't have a problem with anyone smoking it, but I remember the good old days when hotels had no-smoking policies for the comfort of ALL guests. My senior parents checked in a couple of days after we did, and I lived in fear of my dad losing his mind over the ""ganja smell.""Amenities - hahahahaha. ""Workout room"" was three old cardio machines. Thought about hitting the treadmill until I realized the staff room right next door is clearly where the staff goes to smoke cigarettes - no thank you. Well-priced snack bar in the lobby would be convenient, if you could ever find anyone to provide service there. There was NEVER anyone behind the counter, and if you went to the front desk to ask for assistance, they would stare at you blankly while gazing hopelessly at the counter. I liked that the room had a decent-sized fridge and microwave. There's a huge Ralph's about a five minute walk away, so we were able to stock up on some good basics to have in the room (just had to walk past two shockingly seedy motels and lots of homeless men on the street outside the hotel to get there - don't make the walk at 6 am like I did to try and combat my jet lag). I used to live in the area years ago, so I liked the proximity to one of my favorite restaurants, Vivian's Millennial Cafe, which is where you should definitely go for breakfast.I might have enjoyed my stay in my younger days, but as a 38 year old pregnant woman with my four year old in tow, I was generally annoyed.","Thank you for sharing your recent experience with us.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,20,"I would definitely recommend this hotel: The rooms are spacious, clean and comfortable, and the general amenities are excellent. Minor drawback: The highway-facing rooms give you constant traffic noise.The big show-stopper as far as I'm concerned is (from my experience being on the 3rd floor) the internet connection is next to non-existent. I think you get better internet in the remote steppes of Kazakhstan. I ended up having to connect my computer through my mobile phone's mobile hotspot and ended up with a large data roaming bill. Sorta kills the deal.Fix the internet (there's no excuse in 2018) and you've got a decent hotel.","Thank you for staying with us Phil P.

If you sat at one 5 or 6 barstools you would get served - if you sat at one of the other lounge chairs in what is obviously the ""bar area"" you wouldn't get service - just seemed peculiar.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,30,"As a business traveler who spends 40-50 nights a year on the road staying at primarily Hilton/Hyatt/Marriott properties, I have seen many, many hotels during my travels. I was attracted to BLVD due to location and price along with primarily good reviews. My initial review was going to be a 5 all the way but a mishap coupled with apathetic (at best) customer service made me drop my review a notch. The hotel itself is very clean and modern and for the most part, quiet. Room was spacious, amenities were what you would expect. The issue was around their advertised 5pm - 7pm happy hour. Not only is it posted but they tell you about this at check-in. After a long day of playing tourist, we returned to the hotel to take advantage of Happy Hour. We walked into the hotel at 5:02pm and there were two hotel employees sitting at the front desk on their computers. We walked into the bar area where there were four customers sitting with no drinks and the bar was dark. I went back to the front desk to inquire about happy hour and they said the bartender would be back shortly. We waited about 5 minutes and the 4 gentlemen said they had been waiting as well but had not been told why it wasn't open. We decided to return to our room to freshen up and returned at 5:30 and STILL no bartender. The 4 gentlemen said they had seen her but that it had been a few minutes and they had been offered no explanation. I went back to the front desk and was told the bartender would be back. No ""I'm sorry"" or nothing. Seemed like they were too busy surfing on their computers to be too concerned about not honoring their 5-7pm policy. Bartender finally walks past and simply says it will be a few minutes before the bar is open. Again, no apology for the delay, no explanation for the delay. To leave SIX paying customers sitting in your lobby for 30+ minutes and not offer any apology or explanation is simply unacceptable. Had this not occurred, I would highly recommend this property but if you don't care to take care of your customers properly, I will choose to spend my money elsewhere and let people know of my experience.","Thank you for staying with us WLMBRM1965.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,30,"We are locals who had to be out of the house for a few days during renovations in November. This hotel was the only one in the area with an indoor pool - kids wanted to swim, but November is too cold for us to swim outdoors! The pool was perfect - small, but heated like a big bathtub. The location was very close to Universal Studios, which was convenient. The hotel is modern and trendy - many young people staying here. The bar/lounge downstairs had happy hour which was popular. Overall it was a fine experience, but some cons especially with the pool - the main reason we chose this hotel. The pool hours were incorrectly listed in the printed materials (other guests told us was wrong on the web as well) as closing at 7:00 PM - glad we asked for clarification and were told 10:00 PM - otherwise we would have assumed we missed swim hours and wouldn't have tried to swim on a couple of evenings. The pool door was locked 3 of the 4 times we tried, and no access with room key. Had to walk all the way back to the lobby (through the chilly parking garage) to get someone to open the door. Towels not always stocked poolside. And the pool area was pretty drab and depressing - painted grey like the parking garage, with some broken windows. Could use some blue paint on the walls like in the rooms, and some better attention to this area. Final complaint was that my bill at checkout did not reflect the rate I was quoted during my reservation. Had I not asked for a final printout, and also had a printed copy of the emailed reservation, I would have been charged $50 more per night, and more tax. And I think everyone would complain about $28 per day parking fee. That stings. We would probably go back in a similar situation, but if swimming during colder weather is not a priority then there are lots of other nearby hotels I would try first.","Thank you for staying with us chrisfCA.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,30,"I pulled in to the somewhat confusing small parking garage. The first thing as I walked into the lobby was a Swedish man complaining that the hotel was terrible, loud and warning us not to check in. While I'm not as picky as some guests, an irate man is never a good sign. The staff didn't handle him well, and he continued to not be served and complain as we checked in.Also, we booked two rooms at the BLVD hotel, except that one of our party was at this one and the other at the location 3 miles away. Very confusing! Luckily, they had another room to accommodate us. Booking.com sent messages saying we didn't show up at the other location and that we would be charged. We weren't.After this rocky start, the hotel turned out to be decent. We were given rooms next to each other and upgraded to suites for free. Is this because of the man telling us to leave? I'm not sure, but it was nice.The suites had 2 king beds, a dorm-sized refrigerator, microwave and a wet bar. There is a table with 2 chairs. The beds were comfortable and the shower was deluxe.The location is nice for the proximity to Universal Studios. We walked up the street to the park in about 10 minutes. It's not a nice walk, very loud traffic and busy streets, steep hill up to the park. You can get the free shuttle, but we just missed it and didn't want to wait. There is no scenery from the hotel and thankfully, we had rooms that faced away from the really busy street.I didn't love the trendy decor. It makes the rooms dark. We didn't use the pool and wouldn't have known about it if I didn't see some people who had used it. There is a bar in the lobby that we didn't go to either.There is no breakfast served, but you can get something from a little stand in the lobby. Be prepared to wait, there is only one staff member working the stand.Overall, a reasonable place, but definitely would pick a different one if I came to the area again.

Blvd Hotel & Spa,30,"A friend and I were visiting Universal Studios for a day and had to find a hotel to stay at for one night before flying out. Besides upscale hotels that were out of our price range, the Blvd Hotel and Spa was the least expensive (if you call $250/night less expensive) than the Sheraton and others. We expected a lot more for what we paid. The walls were paper thin and we were able to hear long-winded conversations both next door and down the hall. And the parking was terrible. It was the type of parking where you have to pull your card forward in a 2-car bumper to bumper parking space and hope that when you leave the car in back of you is gone. They said that if your car was the outside car, that you're supposed to leave your car keys with the staff so they can move the other car so you can leave. In theory that may work, but on the day we left, there were 2 young ladies waiting to leave and no one knew whose car was in back of them. Thankfully, we found one of only a couple of one car only spaces and didn't have any problem. And on top of that, parking was $20 per night. Won't be staying there again!","Hi Pennie_Wilhelm,We appreciate you taking the time to write a review about your recent stay with us. Thank you for your honest review.

Upon arrival we checked in and were given our keys and parking pass. Once we got to the room my Bank had notified me of my transaction downstairs which was fine until I realized they had over-charged me by $100. A tad confused I contact the front desk, they apologized and told me that was the security deposit and would be refunded after my stay. That would have been nice to know so my account would have been prepared and not been overdrawn. After our trip to the park we went up to our room and got ready for bed. As meticulous as we are, we decided to check the bed for anything that didn't belong. On the top-most comforter was an orange streak the size of a toothpick, unsure of its origin, we removed the comforter. on top of the next sheet was a curly hair, neither of ours.

However, they took a $100 deposit added to my credit card on check-in, which I was unaware that they would do. They said it would take my bank 3 to 5 days to refund it to me.

Our room was the closest to Fairfax Ave and consequently all the traffic noise was clearly heard throughout the night which often can be significant. Additionally when people in other rooms showered or used the toilet we could hear the water gushing through the pipes. I would recommended staying in the newer section. The hotel is opposite the original Farmer's Market which is an interesting place to visit with its collection of food outlets and stores. It is also close to the Grove Shopping Centre.

We do not doctor those photos in any way and we also have a very long running policy that if some one is unhappy with the room after check in in the first few minutes we will try and help to find them accommodations with out any type of penalty or fee.We are redoing our entire lobby that will include self check in stations.This is by no means meant to or will replace the Guest Agents.Self check in is now all around us - Airports, Supermarkets and even restaurants have jumped on this technology.Some people love it some hate but we are transitioning in that direction however as I stated we are using as an addition - Some guest just simply want to get to their rooms or have an early flight to catch but the agents are busy and this will allow the agents an extra hand.The building you were in is where all the TACK ROOMS are located and the Main building where the lobby is located is where all the Robin Room are located.On our website all the rooms are clearly marked and priced accordinglyWe wish the best travels and experiences...ellen and peter",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: May 2019,"Response from picataggio, Owner at Farmer's Daughter Hotel","Responded May 26, 2019"

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,20,"This hotel should only be considered with industrial earplugs. The walls are so thin we heard every noise from surrounding rooms. Our view was of the lift shaft and a vending machine. The ice machine sounded like a jet engine revving up. We had to move rooms in the night as we couldn't sleep for the noise. The staff were cold, unsympathetic and unable to say the word ""sorry"". We were told that despite booking well in advance some rooms were undergoing renovation and that's why we had the bad room. Not what we wanted to hear. No contact from management regarding our disappointing stay, even after I suggested I would be giving a poor review. At $250 per night, was by far the worst high price accommodation I've ever stayed in.","Thank you taking the time to write a review.This is first I am reading or hearing about your issues and i will speak with the staff to understand why it was not brought up before.In the building you were in we had a couple of rooms out of service. Not for renovation but for a broken water pipe. However I understand you did not like your location.We stay full 95% of the time which means we tend to have to play Rubix cube if you will with the rooms getting all our reservations in the door.We do our very best to accommodate every one and all their needs, while we normally never get any complaints in the room you were in we understand that you wanted to move but given the lack of rooms while you were here there was simply no rooms to move.I will be having a discussion with our staff on how to better communicate.We do normally allow people to check out with out penalty if they are un-happy and i am surprised this was no offered.",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: February 2019,"Response from picataggio, Owner at Farmer's Daughter Hotel","Responded Feb 17, 2019"

Nothing wrong with it at all but after seeing reviews saying it’s superb etc etc I felt I should be truthful.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,20,"For location this is absolutely one of my top LA hotels going back several years now. It is nice and simple and easy to get around from here. But be aware, hotels request a personal credit card which is standard, but although traveling on a company account for the hotel, this hotel placed the entire amount over $1000.00 within 24 hours on a hold on my personal credit card, then the next day they added another hold over $700 dollars, then the third day another hold over $300 and on the fourth day a hold over $600 until my bank was calling me saying I could no longer use my personal credit card. This was a stressful experience visiting California and although I worked with my bank and the front desk to rectify the holds on the card, I would never trust their ipad system again.

But that Single King was booked all the way through to our internal systems.Unfortunately we did not have a room with two beds as you would have preferred as our occupancy was close to being sold out.Our internal investigations also show we did offer to give you a roll away bed to help with the issue.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,30,"I was writing this review in my head as we tossed and turned overnight at the Farmer's Daughter. Sleeping on the mattress in Room #208 was akin to sleeping on a yoga mat atop a concrete slab—and I should know, because that's exactly how we slept the night before!After the first sleepless night of our two days without electricity (thanks, #LAHeatwave!), we escaped the 98-degree interior temperatures of our apartment for the air conditioning of The Farmer's Daughter. Everything else about the stay was pretty great: spacious room, chic decor, nice big shower (water pressure was pretty lackluster, though), lots of power outlets and lighting options, friendly staff, clean pool.But from the moment we crawled under the bed's thin, clingy sheet and scratchy, undersized Pendleton blanket, we knew we would not be getting any more sleep in this hotel than we had on our back patio.We've stayed in a lot of hotels at a wide variety of price points. Sometimes the mattress is too firm for me but my husband thinks it's just fine. This was the first time we both found a mattress to be too hard to sleep on. Neither of us fell asleep until about an hour before sunrise!","Hello MrsJohnsonAlthough I am glad to hear you enjoyed most of your stay, I am saddened to hear that the mattress was not to your liking and that it was uncomfortable for you.

I had already checked for bedbugs (none) and verified it was clean. So, I reported it to the “manager.” He called me to apologize and offered drinks or breakfast on the house along with a “discount.”I spoke to Saif and asked him what the discount was he offered. He said $50.00 per night - we were staying two nights! Really? WTF?? I told him I was expecting one night to be “comped.” He said “No, I can’t do that!” Then, he made excuses as to why there were cockroaches on premises. I travel 50-60 nights a year across the country on business, I’m 62, and I have NEVER SEEN A COCKROACH IN ANY HOTEL ROOM!!!Hmmm, $50 on a $250/night room? He should have done more than a 20% discount! Now, I’m forced to tell everyone what a poor decision this was on his part. So, the $200 he didn’t knock off my bill will be lost when someone decides to NOT stay here because of the cockroach I found in my room.Too bad, great location and has possibilities.

The decor is minimalist, so if you like concrete floors this may be the place for you.The service when dealing with staff was always met with a sincere smile which truly makes one feel welcomed.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,10,"My teenage daughter and I had such an awful experience at this hotel, which really would be considered a one-star motel in Alberta, Canada, where we reside. The Check-In was very poor, we were not told of any amenities, the pool looked like a huge bathtub surrounded by 80 rubber duckies (???), the room's heater kept going on and off, loudly, the shower was cold, then hot, and we were allowed 3 tiny drawers between the two of us, in our room. The floor was concrete, and, well, dirty. We were scheduled to stay for 3 nights, but obviously didn't- The next morning, I tried to check out, and was told that the rate for my 1 night stay had - suddenly- increased, it was now $375.00, which would be alright for a luxury hotel, but for a noisy, tiny concrete-floor room where the toilet was practically on top of the bathtub, it was, to use old-fashioned ""country"" expression, ""highway robbery"" Save your money and stay in a nice hotel, where you will be treated with respect and be provided with a clean and comfortable room (we moved to the JW Marriott Hotel, where the room was 4 times the size, the fitness area was huge and apples/lavender-infused towels were served and free headphones, and a large brunch was included, all for less than what I paid at this awful place.

Saif even took our credit card and told us this would be a guarantee room 314 is ours and no one else will have it. After driving 7 hours and being in traffic, we finally arrived at the front desk, was told room 314 was given to someone else, Saif did not leave any notes about reserving room 314 for us, and Saif was not going to be there for a couple of days. It was late and we had no choice, but to take the only room they had available. Upon our arrival, we were exhausted and it was dark so we could not see what was outside our window.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,30,"Loved the location, right across the street from The Grove and Farmers Market. Down the street are the CBS studios, Peet’s Coffee, and around the block are Paper Source and Trader Joe’s. Free WiFi and upscale toiletries are included. But that is all that is included. We were tired and thirsty by the time we got to our room and I was delighted to see two bottles of water on the desk. Then I saw the $4 per bottle price tag. It seemed just about anything in the room that was portable was for sale. The tiny, amateurish paintings on the wall over the bed were $125 each. The throw pillows were for sale at about the same price. The book on the nightstand was for sale. Tacky. There is no privacy in the bath and toilet area which share space with the sink, mirror, closet area, and the only (small) chest of drawers. You need to close off that entire area to have toilet or bath privacy. The AC worked well, but was very noisy. Equally noisy was the housekeeping staff who chatted loudly outside our door at 8:30 in the morning. Housekeeping was very friendly, as were all the personnel we encountered. However, housekeeping left a lot to be desired. The carpet was not vacuumed the time we were there, a dirty cleaning cloth was left alongside our towels, and one day we were shorted towels. There were always potato chips in the lobby with a jar of sage water and one day they had delicious chocolate chip cookies. The beds were very comfy, but the pillows were all feather/down and I ended up using one of the decorative pillows to sleep on. It was easy to get a Lyft ride and save the $24 per night valet parking fees.We stayed at The Farmer’s Daughter because of its proximity to my daughter’s house. It was ok for our short 4-night stay.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,30,"The Farmer's Daughter Hotel is located directly across from The Grove (which is an open-air mall) and the Farmer's Market. Unlike most of LA, there are actually a few restaurants, coffee shops, banks, etc. within walking distance, so that was a plus in my book.The motel itself is pretty cute, but it's not a luxury hotel. They basically took a standard mid-century motor lodge, slapped a couple coats of black paint on it, threw some faux rustic tchotchkes around and voila! You have a hot spot suitable for filming reality TV shows.The rooms themselves were spare, basic, and lacked the creature comforts that would have been appreciated such as slippers. My sense is that they ripped up the existing carpeting and left the concrete floors bares in an effort to be industrial chic. The bathrooms seemed like ""leftovers"" too with flimsy shower curtains toilets with extremely loud flushes, which you don't realize is a problem until after you go to bed. The shower/tub seemed like it could have been one of those plastic ""bathfitter"" inserts that you slap over a hot mess of a bathroom when you're too cheap to renovate. And as I have said in many reviews, I really don't like a sliding door for a bathroom. There's no privacy.There is a nice outdoor seating area with fire pits, a foosball table and succulents.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,10,The sister restaurant (Tart) was running a 50% off your food promotion if you jump in the hotel pool. Great if you like jumping in the pool during hot weather and want cheap food. Not so great if you are a guest at the hotel and want to relax during hot weather in a clean pool. Unacceptable to a guest at a hotel and to be made to feel like you're not welcome.It's a shame as the hotel itself is lovely however this really lets it down and lowers the tone. It's a hotel not a frat party.It also says no diving in the pool. The fact that the people jumping in the pool have been having a bottomless brunch is completely irresponsible!!

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,20,"The hotel looks really cool and the location is great (across the road from the Farmers Market & close to The Grove) but the service fell short. Some of the facilities are quite dated - including air con units in the rooms that were very loud and made sleeping tricky. The main issue for us was when we requested moving rooms as on returning from dinner our room smelt heavily of smoke (in a non smoking hotel) we were made to feel like this was an inconvenience due to another guest (whom hadn't arrived yet at 10pm) being then unable to check in. Appreciate this might be a hotel issue, but it shouldn't have been put to us as guest who had been put out.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,20,"The Farmer's Daughter is clean and in great location but that is where it ends. The hotel seems like it was designed by a 1st year design student who got 4th place due to its impracticability in the real world. The rooms are small, to balance that there is a glass wall between the bedroom and bathroom, if you like going to the bathroom in an aquarium this room is for you. You could close the curtain which then defeats the purpose of the glass wall. They also added a huge mirror, which not only takes up valuable space, anyone sitting on the beds can see you in the bathroom. The beds are small have extremely sharp edges. I defy anyone to spend anytime without getting serious shin bruises. The seating area with table and a stool all of which again takes up valuable space ends up being used for all your belongings. Nowhere to put suitcases The bedside table is a miniature shelf, with the lamp clock and phone nowhere to put your stuff forcing you to leave it on the cement floor.If you are a lone traveler or someone who travels with little stuff, or have lived and worked on a submarine you'll do ok in this room, but a family will not survive such cramped quarters. If you feel claustrophobic there is a seating area outside but in the evening you'd get better light from the moon. And on one side of the building is a construction site that works 7am - 3pm Mon ~Sat They don't mention that until you discover it for yourself. They do have a happy hour ~ Whiskey, who drinks whiskey plus the cups are small and the decanter is 1/3 full. The pool is ok, with rubber ducks floating around but not enough of a plus to stay here.",Thank you for taking the time out of your schedule to write a review.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,30,"We love boutique hotels, this one is ""instagramable"" but not as cool in person.We arrived booked a large room but the person checking us in accidentally gave our room to someone else, and told us that the room we were getting was comparable. It was not it was just a small standard room, we were not going to let that get us down, but came to swim. We were also told that the pool was heated, soon we realized that's not the case. So we asked the manager why we would be told that, and he apologized for us not getting the room we had booked but they were now sold out and he acknowledged that they say its heated but it's just kept at (I think he said 75* ) but that's cold.He was really nice and told us he would help us find another hotel and helped us get a better rate and fully refunded us. We're in our 30's we're looking to just relax and we were not impressed.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,30,"We are stayed here for a wedding. There's some great stuff about this hotel, but so much that's frustrating.Let's talk about the good:1. Location: pretty central to everything. The west side, Hollywood, downtown, Silverlake are all 10-20 minute rides away. Lots of Uber and Lyft drivers around here. Close to the Farmers Market and The Grove (if that's your thing).2. Fantastic outdoor common area for drinks and hanging out. Nice fire pits, heat lamps and umbrellas. It's a good scene.3. Tasty food and drinks, fairly priced for a hotel.4. Fun decor in the rooms.5. Great mix of old school hip hop and 80s music pumping throughout the property at a reasonable volume.The frustrating:1. The pool: is tiny and 85% of the pool area is in the shade all day since it's basically a small courtyard surrounded on 4 sides by buildings. Seriously. Coming from the east coast in the middle of winter, I really prioritize staying at a hotel in LA with a pool. This pool is practically unusable: very little sun, minimal seating, I had to lay out on the concrete pool deck to just enjoy a sliver of sunshine. There's literally two cafe chairs at the poolside and that's it. That said, the pool is kept at 75 degrees and is salt water - both pluses.2. They do not serve drinks at the pool. I was told I had to leave the pool area, if I wanted to have a beer. Not even in a plastic cup. Really? It's as if you want me to never enjoy this pool. Hotel pools all over LA serve food and drinks!3. The plumbing noise is definitely a thing. We heard the rumbles of toilets flushing all night long.4. The maid tried to make up our room at 9am on a Sunday. Can I be miserably hungover in peace? We were not checking out until Monday morning, so there's no reason to wake us up.5. The restaurant on the weekend mornings. We waited for a few minutes and saw no one seating people. We sat down at 11am to eat breakfast and were scolded for (1.) not waiting to be seated (there were numerous empty tables), (2.) not having a reservation, and (3.) wanting to sit for more than an hour. The restaurant appears to be very popular with people who are not guests of the hotel, we were told all the cabanas were to be used for a birthday party starting at noon and all the other tables were reserved. It would be helpful if we were told at check-in to make a reservation for breakfast on the weekend. It seems pretty reasonable that hotel guests who pay $250-300/night should be prioritized to be seated for breakfast, even without a reservation. We felt unwelcome and the entire situation was just awkward.In sum, I would not recommend staying here if you really prioritize a great pool experience. At this price point, there's much better value for your money in LA. At $250-300/night I expect a large pool with tasteful furnishings and poolside food/beverage service. The room itself is a bit dark, but at least clean and cute. The beds were very comfortable. If you need to stay in the this immediate area, it's probably fine for a quick business trip.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,20,"Recently stayed here for a wedding. Was decidedly unimpressed, for the following reasons (note: our room was in the building across the parking lot, unattached from the main building, which I am under the impression is a new part of the hotel. We were told this building was formerly an hourly motel, which is about how it felt). First, our room was directly across from the storage space for housekeeping, who began making noise very early every morning. Second, the bathroom was woeful. We were in a double room, and for some reason the separator from the bathroom (which lacked a separate shower/water closet) was a barn door. Now I know this is trendy, but it turns out barn doors are not sound isolating. So I hope you the whole room knowing when you need to pee. Furthermore, the shower had virtually no water pressure. The women in our room were unable to wash their hair, and every time someone elsewhere in the building flushed a toilet, the pressure and temp would wildly swing. Third, and speaking of toilets, any flush in the building is loud. I was woken up by toilet flushing bangs all night. Finally, the heater/AC unit sounded like a hair dryer is was so loud. Positives did include a fairly comfortable bed, and a good location.

The suite had a great wet bar, dishes, and a mini fridge. The shower was huge and well-appointed.Cons: The price for the value was too high. Then there was the annoying $10 ""amenities charge"" that was not voluntary - despite that a normal guest's schedule would exclude them from both the whiskey tasting AND the morning yoga that this charge pays for. I hate unadvertised up-charges. The concept was mostly well-executed, except for the absolutely horrible dark charcoal walls everywhere, which combined with many bare bulbs, caused super high contrast on the eye and somehow made you feel like you were in the best-lit dungeon on earth.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,30,"During our LA visit we spent 4 nights at this cool little hotel. I travel with a family so I have 2 small kids (9 & 11) I wanted to try something a little more personal by staying at a 'boutique' hotel rather then big chain hotels. But unfortunately I didn't feel the personal touch that I thought you would get and It wasn't like I was saving money by staying here. Location was fabulous!! With the Grove across the road, you certainly have everything at your door step. It does have cool little things, like the bikes and books and pool with rubber duckies and 2 cute little budgies in the lobby!! It's clean, safe and a very good looking place. Room I was in was kind of out under a stair case, so no sunlight shining my room, but you can sit out on the balcony if you wanted. Does have a restaurant TART in house, so that was cool.

I cannot believe I paid almost $300 for the room.The sink was horribly cracked and stained- why go to the trouble to put in a cute faucet and leave the crappy sink? The shower stall was one of the those complete molded units and was old and damaged. You could see where they used putty to cover try to cover up damaged spots. There was rust all over the base of the shower head. The toilet seat was yellowed and stained and appears they tried to paint over part of it. The floor had cute wood laminate but in the shower area they put crappy poorly cut rubber institutional molding - yuck!!!

There's construction/remodeling going on now which I suppose will eventually be over. But hammers and drills that were to stop by 5:30pm were still going well after 7:00pm. The rooms are nice-ish. The floors are exposed concrete except for the rug which is right under the bed. I get that LA isn't exactly cold, but even there it's chilly to put your bare feet down on concrete. No storage in the sink area and what's up with the beige linen curtain in the bathroom? There's a glass wall that separates the bathroom from the rest of the room. A CLEAR glass wall. So if you happen to turn on the light in the middle of the night the rest of room lights up as well. Seriously? We were in room 312 and the only source of natural light was the window that overlooked the parking lot/apartment complex next door. Nothing like the view of cable dishes hanging off balconies.I asked the front desk staff about their discounted Soul Cycle classes (it's promoted on their website) and no one ever got back to me. Even after an email.Room 312 is set back a bit but we heard every single motorcyclist speeding down Fairfax, every single night.If you have business in the area or wanted to walk to LACMA, it is a central location. The price was reasonable ($200 a night +/-) and I don't think there are too many hotels in that range nearby. If I was there by myself (single girl), I would feel safe.","thank you for writing and sharing your experince.We have been doing a bit of remodeling as you pointed and we did have issue's with our contractors knocking about later than they were supposed . I can promise it affected many people and I have been eating crow for a bit about now.The good news is that is done for the most part.There are dimmers on everything and the glass wall did have a pull curtain on it so that you could section off if needed.You did give me an idea for checking people in, and that is giving them an idea of the room and how to control things in it.As for the SOUL CYCLE, irghhhhhh I am so sorry.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,30,"We stayed for 2 nights and were really dissapointed. It's an old motel that has been given a cute paint job and kitch makeover, but this place lacks basic customer service.Hotel staff don't seem to have local knowledge and couldn't point us in the direction of a grocery store (there's a trader joes and Huge farmers market complex across the road, which we found ourselves... We highly recommend the farmers market area for a great variety of eats!)Valet parking is a rip off and no one was willing to help us with our luggage.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,30,"Stayed here for a media event that was being held at the hotel. You can see the bones of the hotel and what it used to be like, but the kitschy updates to turn it into a boutique hotel actually are pretty cool and unique. Beds very comfortable, so was the furniture, but some areas cheap out a little bit -- my room wasn't sealed all that well against outside noise, so I heard every truck that passed on the street through the cracks around the door, and the towels were a bit on the economy-hotel side of the plushness scale. They also heavily perfume the rooms, smells like someone's stuffed a dozen AirWicks in the air conditioning unit. Still, can't beat the location and the staff were universally friendly. Prices reasonable too, I wouldn't mind staying here again.","Thank you for taking the time out of schedule to write a review, it is appreciated.I am glad to read that you liked mostly everything about the room.We are in the middle of a complete refresh on the the rooms, the model room has already been completed and fully tested with just a tremendous amount of positive feedback.The smell in your room is a scent stick that we put in the rooms once per month. The smell is the strongest on the first day.

Farmer's Daughter Hotel,20,"Just stayed a Farmer's Daughter for the third time. When it opened, it was a simple but stylish budget boutique hotel. Now, it's just shabby hodge podge with an inexperienced staff. Our room had a dirty jean bedspread, dirty floors. The coffeemaker didn't work. The room AC went On and off every five minutes all night. There's perfume pumped into the rooms- I needed to have the window open always. People were up in the rooms around us until after 2am. If it were still a 'budget' hotel my expectations might be different, but at $250 a night the place should at least be clean.

The Kinney,10,"Me and my friends stayed at this hotel for 4 nights and I can start of with that it seemed really nice at first.Then one day we were going to the beach and came back to a letter on the bed saying we had to pay a smoking-fee since they thought we had been smoking in the room and that one of the housekeepers had seen us smoking in the room and then we told the ”manager” that we had not smoked in the room and wondered how the housekeeping could have seen us smoking in the room when there was sprinklers there and no smell of smoke? And then he just said that the sprinklers was not so good, well that’s safe if the hotel would caught a fire? They also didnt talk with us about this they just left the letter and took the money from my friends bankaccount. And the day we arrived there I asked the frontdesk where the designated smoking area was and they said we could smoke in front of the hotel and I respected that and did so.The day we checked out we brought up this problem to the ”manager” and they gave us the number and email to the general manager and said we could write or call him/her. Two weeks have passed and we have been trying to call him/her ad email but no answer and we still feel really devastated they took money from us for something we have not done.And I can also write here that they didnt clean the room thorougly and the bathtub was clogged and the airconditioner was broken and the room all in all were moist. And there was blood stains on my sheets, the pool was dirty and the hotel does not look like in the pictures! It’s a scam. It was awful and we brought all of this to their attention and they were not cooperative and really rude.","We are very sorry that our smoke free policy caused additional fees during your stay, one reason the air smells so fresh in our guest rooms when you check in, is our smoke free policy.

The Kinney,30,"This was the last one night stop of our 21 day round trip of California. We stayed in 14 hotels from the Queen Mary through Las Vegas, Death Valley, right round to San Francisco and down the west coast.The Kinney was the last and most expensive of the lot. I don't know if it's trendy or happening but it was a bit of a trek along the main road to the beach. The pool is very small but very welcoming after a hot days travelling. The room was clean but not the best we've had - it was all a bit ya-dee-ya... another hotel room.What I object to - and the reason for three stars - were three things:1/ $25 (plus tip) per night to park in your own onsite car park??2/ $3 per refilled bottle to drink the water in the room??3/ The single option of a bowl of indescribable berries that you describe as a breakfast??

The Kinney,30,"My wife and I stayed here the last two nights following our Route 66 trip across America. We booked 9 months ago when it was the ""Inn at Marina Del Rey"" and since that time it has undergone a refurbishment and changed name (now ""The Kinney"").We were welcomed by an efficient and pleasant youn man (Alex), who confirmed he had provided us with a 3rd floor room towards the back of the property away from the pool and main road. It turned out to be a very quiet room, just as we wished.The room was more of a suite, with a King sized double bed, mirrored wardrobe and a separate living area with couch come sofa bed and a 2nd, bigger TV (one in the proper bedroom as well). There are doors which can be pulled across to separate the two sleeping areas. Small fridge in the room and coffee maker, nice vanity area separate from the bathroom and shower.The decor is very funky, and the room itself was fine.The bad points?Breakfast area is small and when we were there, there were two families with LOTS of kids who occupied most of the seating and made breakfast quite loud and chaotic (not good for other guests, but no fault of the hotel!). Breakfast fare was OK, scrambled egg or omelettes (changes daily I guess?), sausages or bacon, waffle maker, yoghurts, breads and bagels, the usualy stuff.The other bad points were:1. Distance to the beach - it looks near on the map, but it is almost a mile down the street and in 90 degree heat, this is a long, hot walk!2. The pool and lounger area - pool is tiny with a separate smaller hot tub (that's OK, we can manage). However, the biggest issue is that the lounge area doesn't get ANY sun after 3pm, as it is in an inner courtyard. Come on managers, install a big adjustable mirror or something so that guests can continue to enjoy the sun up until sundown! Surely its not beyond the wit of man?This was the biggest downer on the hotel, which otherwise would have earnt a 4 star rating from me!","Dear PathManSlough,On behalf of The Kinney management and staff I would like to thank you for your recent stay.

Disappointingly there is little in the way of apology from the hotel regarding this, apart from a notice in the lift. As noted by other reviewers it would have been good had the hotel advised guests of the renovations so that consideration could have been given to cancellation.Our room appeared to have been updated aside from the Keurig coffee maker, although another brand of coffee maker was in the room. The room was very clean.The housekeeping staff were always friendly however the same can not be said for the front desk staff - their attitude seemed to be disinterested.There is little in the immediate vicinity of the hotel, you will need to walk or drive to find places to eat. We ate both nights at the Cheesecake Factory which is about a 15 minute walk away, the meals there were great.On checking out we advised that we wanted to pay in cash. Front Desk advised that they do not normally accept cash, and it would be best if they used the credit card details held. We advised that this did not suit us, she agreed to accept payment in cash 'as a favour' to us. I would suggest that if the hotel does not accept cash that this should be highlighted in confirmation emails and also on their website. In our 7 weeks travelling around USA we stayed in numerous hotels and this was the only hotel where payment in the form of cash was an issue.The room itself rated as very good however the renovations and the attitude of the front desk staff made the overall experience only an average rating.","Dear kiwitravellers07,Thank you for your review!

The Kinney,20,"3 nights at this place booked about 6 months ago. I was surprised to say the least on arrival that the place was in the middle of extensive renovations. It really grinds my gears that I was not informed at the time of booking or any time since that the renovations were happening and given the chance to reconsider my booking but no.The renovations meant there was no reception area and you had to enter through the underground car park. Also there was no dining room so breakfast was served in one of the rooms! This was not ideal and after the first days chaos we didn't bother .The room itself was great, freshly renovated, spacious and clean.The hotel was very accommodating as my daughter flew in from New York to see us and they provided a roll out bed with no charge.It is a great location with walking distance to the Albert Kinney bars and eateries and a quick uber to Venice.It's just a shame our stay was spoiled for me but the lack of openness and honesty over the renovations.

The place is under construction - messy carpets in the halls and lots of plaster dust in the air. I felt ripped off by the price.

The Kinney,30,Spent one night last weekend and glad we weren't staying any longer. Room was just ok. Recently renovated and smells of paint and a lot of the renovation is clearly 'surface only' and trying to turn the place into a 'trendy' hotel. Our closet door fell off and our shower was interrupted by service staff telling us that water was leaking into the room below (no leaks apparent in our bathroom so he said it was coming from behind the wall). Poor woman alone at the front desk seemed overwhelmed and when we checked out there was a very upset couple who just arrived for 5 nights and their reservation couldn't be honored. It's a pretty good location and the trendy Abbot Kinney street is a 10 minute walk away and Venice boardwalk is another 5 minutes.,"Dear Cool_Traveling,I am delighted that you choose the Inn at Marina del Rey for your visit.

The Kinney,20,"The location leaves a lot to be desired. There's not a lot within walking distance - a liquor store next door, a Caribbean resturant across the street, I think there was a Rite Aid a couple of blocks up the road. Other than that, there's not much else at all. Venice Beach is about a ten minute drive away, and Santa Monica is around 20mins. So if you don't mind driving everywhere, I guess the location is okay.I found the front office staff very unfriendly and unhelpful. They didn't respond to the two emails I sent them prior to our arrival, which resulted in our reservation being incorrect. A mistake on their behalf, not mine.Every time we walked past them in the front office, they were on their phones. The customer service was awful, there was not one redeeming quality among the staff that I encountered.The rooms were okay. I liked the big bathroom in our room, and the water pressure and hot water was great. I didn't like that the doors to the rooms didn't have stoppers. Every time a door was closed it SLAMMED. It sounded like someone was kicking at our door.Despite all that it was a nice hotel.

The Kinney,30,"In Los Angeles area for a couple of meetings. This is an old 50s era beach hotel that has been renovated. On the plus side - good location close to LAX, comfortable bed with clean linens, free parking, decent shower pressure, decent price for LA. On the minus side - the hallways were outside and open to the elements, the neighborhood had a little bit of a sketchy feel, the doors to the rooms were flimsy and felt a little insecure (I would not recommend this hotel to a woman traveling alone who likes to feel completely safe and secure), the bathroom sink area was extremely poorly lit. Located about 15 minutes walk from the pier and the beach.

The Kinney,30,"Stayed here for 2 nights during the Los Angeles portion of our trip.Pros: Clean, free parking and wifi, decent breakfast, friendly staff (especially the breakfast attendant!!!!), competitively priced for a hotel in this vicinity, great outdoor sitting area.Cons: Not close to anything worth walking to (Venice Beach is 1 mile away, the nice part of Marina Del Rey is about the same distance), on the very edge of Marina Del Rey & Venice.Overall: We stayed here because we were taking the Rasta Bus Tour of LA and they picked up here. It was one of the more affordable hotels on their pickup list. We were gone the whole day and pretty much just slept here. If you are hanging out at the hotel all day (for relaxation) then I would splurge and choose another hotel.

The Kinney,30,This was our last stop after six weeks travelling the States.We booked through hotel club and it cost around $270 AUD for the night.We arrived quite early for check in and although they could not put us in a room straight away they looked after our bags for us whilst we went exploring.We walked over to the actual Marina which took around 5-10 minutes. Had a drink then we walked to Venice beach. The Inn is located on the main road which runs down to the North end of Venice beach it takes about a 20 minute to walk it or a 5 minute bus ride.Anyhow back to the Inn at Marina Del Rey. The rooms are quite spacious were in a room looking over a back street which was not busy with little or noise to disturb us.The bed was quite comfy.Next to the swimming pool there is quite a nice spa/ whirlpool which is nice and hot. The pool would have been ok but we did not use it as for some reason there was sand all over the bottom of the pool which made it look slightly unkept.The breakfast was not memorable except for the paper plates. LOLA big plus was the staff they were very friendly and helpful.As there is no consistent hotel rating policy across the world I have started to give my own personal star rating.For The Inn at Marina Del Rey I am going to call it a 21/2 star hotel.If I was in the area again I may stay there again but probably not.,"Dear SPTravelling,We sincerely appreciate the time you spent on this review.

According to hotel personnel that problem will be soon resolved via already planned renovation.Breakfast room indeed the weak spot of this hotel, too small and making the food selection and breakfast consumption a bit uncomfortable if crowded.Also the pool rather compact, but such a nice beach did not really make it too needed.Safe boxes at main desk only.For the rest, personnel friendly and service oriented.Overall a good base for vacations in Marina del Rey / Venice beach area in terms of $ to value.","Dear Dado_63xx,Your comments are greatly appreciated.

The room was average and could use some updating, the beds were comfy. The bathroom was very tired as was the single robe hanging in the closet.There was cute outdoor seating area on the second level, but we were only there for less than 15 hours so we didn't take advantage, or even see the pool or fitness center.

The Kinney,30,"We had decided to book a room at the Inn at Marina del Rey based on the good reviews; but we were disappointed. On our road trips we have experienced much better value for the money at other places. Our queen deluxe room (at USD 240) was spacious and had a microwave, fridge, flatscreen tv and free wifi (all of which is nowadays pretty much standard, even in cheaper accommodations). The bedlinen was rough though and the bathroom ventilator loud & dusty. The view out of the window showed a backyard full of trash (not the property of the Inn, but we were not sure then if we wanted to go out into that neighbourhood). We appreciated the continental breakfast (but again, we have experienced better quality in other hotels).

Please be careful when staying here.,"Dear DBrown014,We take the safety and security of our guests and team members very seriously. To that end, we were very concerned to hear that a theft may have occurred at our hotel. We reviewed all available surveillance video of the property, reviewed the electronic records of the door locks, and had the local police come to the hotel to conduct a thorough investigation. Unfortunately, the police were unable to find any evidence that a theft occurred. The data from the door lock showed no entry to the room during the period of time in question, and the surveillance video provided no leads either. Notwithstanding this lack of tangible evidence of theft, we did attempt to offer you compensation for your claim, which you declined.

The Kinney,30,"As an upfront disclaimer, there was an issue with our reservation which was handled poorly; that portion of the review will follow after the review of the hotel itself.The Inn at Marina Del Rey is located about a 5 minute drive from Venice Beach; they also offer bike rentals should you choose to bike there, which might be better depending on the time of day and how much you are carrying with you due to the high volume of traffic the beach can see on the weekends.We stayed in a King Suite for our stay; the room consists of a living room with a pull out sofa bed, study desk, and tv sitting on a dresser. This room is connect by a short hallway to the other room , where the King bed, two night stands, another dresser with tv are located; the bathroom is located in a room off the hallway.The room seemed very dated, from the style of the furnishings to the actual age of the furnishings everything just appeared to be ""older"" and not in line with the sleeker glassed-in pool/hot tub and dark wicker lounge area located on the second floor. In the night our AC unit was very loud and literally sounded like a small vehicle was starting every time it came on. The bed was fairly comfortable. The room did come with a microwave, and refrigerator. All in all, the room was a good fit for my wife and I to sleep on the king bed and have our 17 month old son on the pull out bed in the other room, boxed in by our suitcases :)Now, on to the service. The breakfast staff was outstanding; very nice and courteous and genuinely happy to help...as was the grounds staff.Upon checking in, one of our reservations was lost. We had two rooms reserved and when we check in, only one was available and it was for the wrong style of room. I was asked for the confirmation number of the reservations and the confirmation email; I still retained the confirmation numbers, but I mishandled the email. Using the numbers they were able to determine that one was for the king room (not suite) and the other was a totally different name; this was blamed on their faulty systems. After the reservations were initially made with Ilee, I called a few weeks later to change from the queen suite to the king suite; I suspect that when this change was made whoever I spoke with changed to the king room and removed the other reservation. After an hour of trying to get this straightened out with Alex my party and I were given our rooms; Alex followed my wife and I to our wrong room where our luggage was and inquired if everything was ok; my wife expressed our annoyance at the situation and the lack of ownership of responsibility on the hotel's part. He assured us that a manager would contact us and be able to resolve the situation.Two days later, on the day before we were to check out my wife and I returned to our room to find that both room keys (which were carried separately and away from phones and credit cards) were not working. My wife went downstairs to get them reset; she asked what room number, reservation name, and if we'd be extending our stay. I also suspect our cards were reset for the express purpose of finding out if we would be extending our stay b/c the hotel was so booked. Why not just call us or ask us face to face without all of the cloak and dagger.Anyway, upon check out Fari assisted me. She asked if I would like to put the charges on the same card as the reservation; I asked how much it was b/c we were supposed to be contact by a manager due to the issues we had with our reservation. I further explained how it seemed that the staff there did not come of as genuine when it came to resolving our issues and they seemed to tell you what you want to hear at the time being with no follow through. Fari apologized for that and explained how Stacy was in meetings and probably the reason she did not contact us; she proceeded to comp one night for one of the rooms.I think all in all, we could have just had an anomaly of a stay there, but either way the staff could attend to problem issues like this with more sincerity and desire to resolve rather than just move you along.","Dear Mr_Mrs_TravelFoodies,Thank you for taking the time to offer us this detailed review.

The Kinney,20,"Overall, this probably isn't bad as an off-chain budget hotel, especially given the location. However, there were definitely issues with my stay. The two primary ones were: Spiders. I killed two in my room then after returning home was bitten on the leg by another that came home with me hiding in a pair of pants that were in my open suitcase. The second is noise; this building is a converted old apartment building. The room next to me had children running around and into the wall which shook the headboard, another morning I was woken up by a couple 'in the throws of passion'.I would also note that the gym and pool deserve quotation marks, because they are not at all functional, you basically have a 3 person hot tub and a very long cool pool. So, expect to do your working out elsewhere or go for a run if you need mid-week exercise.The pros: Wonderful staff, really they are the shining gem of this place.

It's in the 'beach area' and near several things.It's direct surroundings are not fantastic but close enough to places.Check in process went ok, not major attention or detail.Room.. Room is somewhat dated both in looks and in comfort. If the AC was not on it was very (uncomfortably) hot in the room. The AC is super old and loud and main main huge problem is the windows are not sound proof..

I was there on business and with no way to sleep it does not make it easy..I called the front desk to change rooms, they said they would call back and I didn't hear back.The area to arrive to my room was also past the pool and it was constantly wet even though I never saw anyone in the pool.Breakfast was fine and included.On the positive note, the staff was friendly though.No room service.","Dear Roukiat,Thank you for taking the time to offer us your valuable feedback.

The Kinney,30,"Did I stay at the same hotel as the rest of the reviews? Yes the hotel is near the beach, but that is about all I liked about the hotel. The hotel was a dated old motel. Our room was a standard room, definitely nothing special. In fact the indoor outdoor carpet in the hallway outside my room reeked of urine. Not sure if was animal or human. Washington Blvd is very busy with sirens during the night. The breakfast was generous, but crowded. As we left breakfast, a homeless man was entering to help himself to food.

The Kinney,30,"This hotel is very average. We initially booked for 5 nights, but the smell on the third floor between room 306 and 310 was foul. The carpet itself is soaked with some overpowering perfume that lead to a bad mix of clean and foul. We checked out 3 night earlier just to live somewhere half the price, and better quality of room and bedding. The breakfast is mediocre, omelettes cooked in advance, and your usual plastic plates and cutlery for breakfast. The breakfast table filled up fast, leaving for very little space to get a refill juice or more food. Location wise, its good because I was taking a course nearby. The elevator was a joke, extremely slow, low lighting, and it shakes at every floor. The hotel should be a little safer, the hotel door automatically open, since this area is not very safe and you don't know who might wanna pass by looking for shelter. The only good part is the high speed internet, that is truly high speed and will not ask you every minute for a password.Overall too expensive for no luxury, not my cup of tea","Dear omaiaa0p,Thank you for the time you spent on this review.

The Kinney,30,Arriving into LAX in the evening I booked this hotel as an alternative to one of the many airport hotels. I thought it would be more pleasant but the actual location of the hotel is not in a great area. The staff we encountered were very pleasant but the rooms were tired and the pool was tiny.

The Kinney,20,"First, the location: a busy street in a so-so feeling neighborhood. One block away is the beautiful marina but that one block feels like 10 miles. Then the smell. The outdoor carpeting on the way to the room STUNK like mold and mildew. Then the room. Okay overall. Smaller than we expected for a 1 br suite. Couch was old and uncomfortable. Bed felt small for a queen size and not very comfortable. Relatively clean. Clearly recently updated but they only put in about half effort on the job. The excellent staff actually offered me an upgrade when we checked out early because I had said that the room was smaller than we needed (which was also true). The major issue was the thin walls. We have a toddler and a newborn, so there is going to be some noise with our family. Only an hour after check in we received a direct call complaint from a guest and then a subsequent call from the front desk about noise. Kids are kids and we were checking it at nearly midnight thanks to a four hour flight delay. The desk person admitted that the walls were rather thin at the hotel. We have stayed at numerous hotels before without issue, and after we moved to a Residence Inn there again were no complaints from other guests. I reiterate that everyone on the staff was excellent and very accommodating.","Dear mfs1981,Thank you for the time you spent on this review.

The Kinney,30,"I think this hotel was as expected from reading reviews on Tripadvisor. I was not that keen on the area, the marina or venice beach but we needed to book a reasonably priced airport hotel, with free parking and this fit the bill. Don;t be deceived by the pictures of the rooms: these are the upgraded rooms that we certainly didn't get to see! The rooms look dated but in actual fact are spacious, comfortable just a little dated to look at! The pool area is modernised and pleasant: just very small so I wouldn;t like to imagine what this is like in peak season. Very close the airport and a route that avoids traffic means I would probably stay again in this area, but perhaps try another hotel by the marina. The breakfast is a bit tacky and cheap - plastic utensils are never a sign of quality.","Thank you for the time you spent to write this review. Your comments are truly appreciated.

The Kinney,30,"I recently spent a night here & all I can say about it is that it's fine. I wasn't on vacation, just a quick overnight trip. When booking you can get a better deal over the internet if you have AAA. Before checking in call & tell them that you do NOT want a room overlooking Washington - a VERY loud & busy street. If your visiting the Marina for vacation & you want a really nice place to stay I would recommend The Marriott or if your budget allows The Ritz Carlton is gorgeous. The Inn is well located for shopping & restaurants but it's too far to walk to the beach & beach parking is almost impossible to come by in the Marina. The staff was nice, the room was clean, but it had a weird musty smell, like it need to be aired out. Unfortunately my room was right next to the tiny pool that was filled with a few loud people who were drinking - gross. So, I closed the windows & got used to the smell. Btw, they should get better quality mattresses.","Thank you for your review, Paula!

We could clearly hear conversations and the radio from upstairs, and when luggage carts were being rolled around it sounded like the start of an earthquake.

The Kinney,10,"I stayed at this property recently for its location and reviews. However, it fell far short of my expectations. The included breakfast was great, but not even close enough to offset my experience..Be aware: the guy that works in morning WILL try to hard sell you on tours. His persistence borders on harassment, maybe I should not have said ""I will think about it."" This prompted him to follow up with a call shortly after - when I had only MINUTES to think about it. Clearly I had not made a decision that quick after a long flight... He asked me twice more after that..I also did not receive the room that I had reserved. After reserving a suite with a queen bed, I was checked into a room with a king bed - no suite. My only interaction with the manager, Dustin, was brief. I only remember his name because of his rude and short nature. I come from a customer service background of nearly 20 years. Businesses that rely heavily on a customer base to remain profitable and successful, should truly value their customers and treat them with the importance that they are.Dustin seemed indifferent to my concerns, and could not even maintain eye contact with me in our short conversation. I wonder how a person like this was ever put in charge of a business.In summation, I will never return to this place again.

The Kinney,30,"We choose The Inn at Marina Del Ray based on price and reviews on this site. To start, it's a bit of a walk to Venice Beach and Marina del Ray. If you're driving, not a problem; plus they have parking. It's a solid 3 star, nothing more; but a decent one. 24 hour front desk, some very friendly and helpful, others, not so much. The rooms are not bad. Spacious, clean and have everything you could need. The beds large an deceptively comfortable. Bathrooms are a European set up: shower and toilet are separate from the sink/vanity. Always plus in my book.Do your self a favour and try your best not to get one of the front rooms, they face onto Washington blvd. super loud, not a great sleeping experience.The free breakfast is fantastic and has a great selection. The dining area is small and very busy. It can be a real dog fight to find a table, or you could just grab your Breakfast and head up to the lovely roof top patio and escape the chaos.We paid $150 for a Tuesday night and $190 for the Wednesday.

The Kinney,20,"I booked this hotel through Hot Wire and found out, to my surprise, that I had paid more than if I had booked directly ($258 for one night). Nevertheless I would have been satisfied if the hotel had been what I expected. This was not the case. The good point is the location close to the Venice canals, the beach, and the airport (although the street, itself, is very busy and feels unsafe). The hotel also has a free parking garage. End of the good points.The rest was a series of irritations: the staff was incredibly incompetent and unconcerned about problems they had created. Only one elevator, but many rooms with long corridors. The keys did not work, so return to the lobby. The room turned out to have only one bed plus a sofa for the four of us. Return to the lobby to get new room. Finally settled in a somewhat shabby room but, at least, with two beds, when a guest opened the door. They had given her our room, which meant that I had to return to the lobby again to get new keys. Worst of all was breakfast. The hotel is very large, therefore has many visitors, but the breakfast room can sit less than 20 people, so two thirds of the guests must carry whatever they were able to grab elsewhere. I have never EVER seen such a mess at breakfast! Squat and gobble is a nice way to describe it. Needless to say, I will never return. By the way, the next day we spent the night at the Westin in Pasadena.

The front desk staff are very helpful though, with any enquiries. and the free coffee available all day was a very nice and appreciated gesture. The fact that there were many amenities within 1 mile (several supermarkets, lots of great restaurants, drugstores etc) meant location was excellent. The free car park was great as well.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",10,"I don't think I've ever left a one star review, but our experience here was beyond unsatisfactory. We checked into our first room only to find one of the chairs at the bar in the kitchenette was covered with what appeared to be weed and a weed package. It had clearly not been cleaned. We went back to the front desk and requested a second room. We were given a room which, unbelievably had the same substance that looked like flakes of weed on BOTH chairs in the kitchenette, but this time without the package. Additionally, one of the light switches in the room had two orange fingerprints on it which I wiped off easily with a wet washcloth. We returned to the front desk to ask somebody to please clean the room again because it obviously had not been properly cleaned, despite the sealed Hilton ""clean stay"" sticker on the door. They sent housekeeping up and then told us the room has been cleaned again. We returned to the room only to find several additional issues. Please see the photos below for what was wiped off of the leatherette chairs in the kitchenette and the stain that was easily wiped off of the leatherette chaise in the bedroom. There was also what appeared to be a food streak on the wallpaper, that again, was easily wiped off with a wet paper towel. I took videos that showed how easily the dirty areas were cleaned, but can't load them here. Hopefully, someone from Hilton contacts me so I can forward them the videos. Because we were leaving early the next morning for a flight, we elected to stay anyway and proceeded to clean all the surfaces in the room with sani-wipes as best we could. We asked to speak with a manager at the time to express our dissatisfaction, but no one was available. Given the property is assuring everyone that the rooms are basically sterilized between visits, encountering obvious filth in two ostensibly cleaned rooms was inexcusable. One mistake is a mistake.

The sales department was responsive when I inquired about booking a meeting room.The customer service at this location was poor before the shut down. Room upgrades are no longer offered so I paid for the suite with a view of the airport last week and still got the view of Carls Jr.The roof view is great but its dirty, closes early, and has no shade during the day.Parking is $50. In Feb they offered Diamond Members hot breakfast. Now the hotel charged $10 for a grab n go breakfast which is a generic bottle of warm water, cold dry untoasted bagel, and a child's apple. Still had to buy coffee at coffee bean.The bartender was friendly. I reserved my tips for him.Check out was a disaster! I needed food folio charges split off the bill. The desk clerk clearly did not know the process. Her manager Annie refused to come out the office. Between her walking back and forth and getting help from a coworker it took about an hour for me to get on the road.I am empathetic to essential workers and how difficult it must be to work in hotels post pandemic.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",10,"Everything terrible, from the beginning. When you call, after your 24 hours of flying, to ask WTF you get the airport shuttle to the hotel. They make you listen to two 1 minute explanations of Covid bs, about what services aren’t offered, then press other buttons, blah, blah, blah. Yeah I’ve wandered around with my stuff for 20 minutes. How about just answering the phone? Then, when they finally answer, they explain you should go up to departures. Makes sense right? You have arrived, but you should go up to departures. But Mike! That’s the airport that determines where the hotel shuttles can operate. Yeah, but how about a f’ing sign somewhere? How about not making me stand in the middle of the night, waiting for the information. How is this covid BS info important?The shuttle never comes. I arrive by taxi, after giving up on the shuttle, and at 11:30 pm, the front door is locked. I unload my bags from taxi. Three people sitting at the front desk do nothing to unlock the door even after I knock. Finally one comes and opens the door. No one offers to help me with my bags. So I ask, if they have a cart I can borrow. “No, we do not.” So I have to somehow manage my 80 pounds of gear, spread around 4 bags, without that recent invention, the wheel. No man to help me?The room was clean, the room is fine. But no water or drinks of any kind in the room? No snacks at all? But Mike, it is terribly inconvenient for us to have to check about mini bar usage when you check out. That would require work and communication. So we just decided, no drinks or snacks in the room. A little peckish after your days of travel? Want to buy $1 cookies for $10? Too bad, no can do.There is no main light switch in the room. You have to wander around, in the dark, trying to find, pimple sized light switches, so you can see where you are. There were other problems. But let me just say this. After traveling 24-36 hours, through multiple airports, finally arriving in your homeland, where you want to be greeted with a smile, and some help with your things, it will not happen here. There is no f’ing hospitality at this hotel. It sucks. Please just FOAD, please to not respond with some BS to this review. Just get your F’ing house in order. When someone arrives by taxi, with a bunch of bags, someone should then open the door, and some help should be offered with the bags.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",20,"I have to say it’s one of my worse experience with Hilton brand hotel.1. When I arrived at 12:30pm, there is a long line at check in counter, some guest is not wearing mask.2. I requested a room that has not been occupied in the previous 24 hours, they said it’s available. But they charge me $59 for early check in (12:30pm when I checked in) even though the room is available at that time. Apparently their normal check in time is 4pm. There will be another $59 if you want a late check out as they told me.3. No complementary water in the room. They said they simply don’t provide that due to the pandemic (don’t know if previous guests touched them), but I don’t understand why they can’t provide complementary bottled water when the new guests requested that.4. Hair conditioner in the bathroom is 1/3 full. It makes you nervous wondering if was used by previous guests. Not good with the virus situation, red flag with the room cleaning.Good location to airport and good shuttle bus service.","yvokino - we appreciate your time in posting comments about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear that you were not 100% satisfied with your stay.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",20,"Stayed here early may in the midst of COVID madness. It did not appear that the hotel was really ready to deal with pandemic. Everyone working at the hotel wore masks, but I noticed the following...- hotel staff would crowd into elevators with us - not observing 6 feet distance.- no hand sanitizer at the front desk, restaurant, etc.- at check-in, i was handed a pen to sign that everyone was using checking in. No cleaning of the pen or touch screens was taking place.- No sanitizing of any of the hotel doors, elevator buttons, luggage carts, etc. was observed.- The 8th floor deck had cups, plates and other trash sitting out on the tables for the entirety of our stay. It was clear no one was cleaning up there.- I also would have expected a more thorough room cleaning. We found dirty towels in the closet and after wiping down surfaces with our clorox wipes, they came up with dirt on them.Also, we booked a room that claimed to have an airport view. While there were 3 windows that looked out at the airport, the outside of the windows were so dirty you could barely see out of them.As others have mentioned... $44 for parking and the gas station style breakfast is n to up to Hilton Gold Standards.Some nice things about the hotel... Rooms are large, bathroom is very nice, the hotel has a nice look to it and the deck on the top has a great view.I would have shared all of this with the hotel if anyone asked me how my stay was at checkout.","ushela03 - we appreciate your time in posting comments about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear that you were not 100% satisfied with your stay.

The hotel is brand new, the decor is beautiful, rooms are very comfortable and it’s conveniently located near LAX. But apart from that there’s nothing “Hilton” about it, forget about the Curio brand. Employees are indifferent to your comfort, turn their backs on you or bend the facts nettle you the most. When you walk in to check in, the staff won’t even say “Hello”, and they will keep you waiting to hand you over the room keys. Surprisingly, the lobby of “Homewood Suites” is at the same place, and people at their front desk would welcome you warmly. If you ask for tea/coffee pods, it never arrives. The breakfast was complimentary for us (being Diamond members), but guess what, they charge you for the tea/coffee. I have stayed at dozens of Hilton property this year, and this is the worst. The shuttle service to LAX is prompt and the driver was extremely helpful.Hilton should probably take notice that just making a property beautiful will not do it, the guest services has to be at par. I give a 1 star just because of the brand new property. This is by far the worst Hilton I have stayed in years when it comes to how cold the staff is.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",10,"We travel to this area routinely and decided to try this new H Curio Hilton property. The rooms were nice (not great), but the Diamond benefits were negligible. There is no Diamond club, the parking cost is twice what other Hilton's charge within a 3 mile radius, and the breakfast for Diamonds was a bowl of fruit, piece of toast, cup of coffee, and glass of orange juice, much below other local Hilton properties; e.g made to order omelets at nearby Hilton's. I asked about the lack of service and was invited to check out. Hilton has a make it right policy, but this hotel doesn't abide by that. The benefit of being here is a short trip to the airport, but many other Hilton properties have shuttles, are nearby, and give much better service.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",10,"My sister and I were traveling to Tahiti with a day and a half stopover in LA. We contacted a few hotels asking for early check in and late check out. For this hotel, we were given the manager, Rodolfos name. When emailing him to ask for the charges, he responded once asking for which hotel it was since two hotels share the same building. After that and several emails, i guess it wasn’t worth his time to reply for a 1-2 night stay. The location was really good from the airport so we decided to book anyways through Expedia since we didn’t receive a reply through him. When we arrived the lady who checked us in provided the WORST RECEPTION SERVICE I have EVER received. We stated that we asked for early check in and late check out the following day. She said she couldn’t provide the rate for the late check out since we booked through Expedia. How are we going to pay the extra charge if you aren’t going to tell us what it is?!?!? This in itself was a 10 minute conversation. Anyways, she finally quoted the rate which was less than what we were initially told then went back and said you have a higher rate and wouldn’t honour what she just quoted. We ended up confirming to pay for an extra night at $209 for the later check out. When she passed over the credit card machine, it wasn’t for the amount we agreed upon. She didn’t know if she was coming or going and was coming up with numbers off the top of her head and changing her mind in mid-conversation. If this wasn’t bad enough, the following morning we went down to confirm the late check out, we were told that she had us checking out the same day we checked in and charged us for the night because we didn’t leave!!!! Furious wasn’t the word. Miranda was at the desk in the morning and was very professional and helpful in resolving a bad situation that only got worse. She fixed the errors and the rest of the stay was pleasant. She was very helpful in finding tours as well. The rooms were also nice as well. These are the only two positive things about the stay.For the reasons mentioned above and Rudolfos lack of response for a manager and Ellen’s beyond poor customer service, I would find another hotel nearby that would be happy to accept your business.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",30,"Prior to staying in LA at H Hotel, we stayed at a fabulous 4 star Hotel in Vancouver(which should've been a 5 star because of the amenities), so that increased our expectation of what a 4 star hotel should be from the get go. However, we'd stayed at 4 stars previously and so we understood the expectation for the level of service at such hotels.Upon Arrival at the airport, there are airport shuttles that take you to and from the hotels around LAX. When we were greeted by the driver, he asked us all these questions, almost as if he didn't believe us when we said we were staying at H Hotel, like we couldn't afford this hotel. Particularly, he asked if we weren't staying at one of the other chains like the Holiday Inn...if we were getting on the right bus. I can understand if someone is making sure you're on the right but because getting lost isn't pleasant, especially at the airport, however the attitude that came with how he asked, to us, that was a bit of an insult. But we were in a good mood, it was our first time in LA and after kindly confirming to the driver we were going to the right hotel and to be a little less rude to people when they got on the bus, we were on our way.When we got to reception, the first thing that stood out was that it is a shared reception between the H Hotel and another 3 star Hotel (which is on the other side). Although the H Hotel had a beautiful reception / foyer area, the fact that reception was shared, that wasn't clear when we made the purchase for our hotel rooms. What we also came to realize was that there were a lot of shared services and amenities (ex. Pool is shared, cleaning staff shared, etc.) although many amenities such as business centre, 24/7 gym and roof top deck were not shared.Our room was large, and the bathroom was large and beautiful, but the cleaning staff wasnt the greatedt at cleaning the bathrooms as I recall always seeing some residue from soaps used the day before still in the shower. Further there were technical difficulties with the tv which made it difficult to watch and the fridge was not as cool (cold) (picture attached).Further, we got slippers where the package was open (picture attached). There was no bottled water, we had to go the gym to get water for the machine.If one needs room service, the H Hotel has a cool robot that can get things to your room, but other than that we weren't really impressed.Although not a horrible experience and conveniently located next to the bus station, I would save my money and go to a hotel that isn't physically attached to a 3 star (homewood suites) as it does have an impact on the ambience and expectations and the total experience that you have for a 4 star hotel... and also, why pay more if you could go next door and probably get a cheaper room.","SC1233 - we appreciate your time in providing feedback about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear that you were disappointed during your visit.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",30,"I loved this hotel when I stayed at the beginning of December (rooftop deck, excellent snack bar, friendly staff). I was all set to write a glowing review, but the holidays got in the way. Fast forward one month to my most recent stay, and I have a very different view. The problems started when I checked in and could not select my room. Most of the time it doesn’t matter, but the king room sizes and layouts differ dramatically in this hotel. The first room they gave me smelled heavily of fragrance, which gives me headaches. A front desk person brings me keys to a new room, and it literally wraps around the elevator (visible via the floor plan) and has an adjoining door to the next-door room (when will hotels realize that solo women travelers don’t like this?). Then he moves me to a room that smells like mildew and still has the air purifier machine plugged into the wall. Why would you put a person who switched from her initial room for smell to a room that smells so badly that you have to bring out the machine?! I finally give up and take the elevator/adjoining one since it at least smelled fine. Big mistake. The plane noise is so loud. It was nonexistent during my first trip so location in this hotel is a big consideration. Cleanliness of the room could also have been improved whereas I was treated to a pristine room on the first trip. It’s unfortunate that I had such a different second experience as I raved about this hotel after my first stay. I travel to LA quite frequently, and it looks like I may have to find a new go-to hotel.","Dear drtravelgirl,Thank you for taking the time in posting comments about your recent experience at our hotel.

The room is Queen size twin room. After a 15-hour flight, we arrived at the hotel lobby at around midnight on August 10 to check in. However, when I checked in, the man who served me at the front desk told me that the air conditioner was broken and could not repair until tomorrow morning.

So I accepted the fact and told him that we just wanted to move in ASAP. After I paid the room fee, the man left for 20 minutes without any reason. Twenty minutes later, he came back and told me the queen size twin room was not available. There was only one queen size room can be served. We are three people, and my reservation is not this!In this regard, I asked him to cancel my order and return the fee I had paid before.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",30,"Spent a weekend here writing, with my husband along for the fun. With it's super close proximity to the airport, it's no wonder this hotel was designed for convenience.Because the hotel is so new, everything is pretty nice- not luxurious but nice. Basic quality. Design is modern which I love. The H is actually set above another Hilton family hotel and they share some common areas.Grounds are SUPER small. Squished between a car rental place and a super busy street. Definitely built up. Tiny pool is facing the street side with greenery blocking the fence. That actually looked pretty cool. Rooftop lounge area was a fun night time adventure as well. Great view of the LAX sign.Okay so the technology... For an economically friendly Hilton family hotel, the technology surprised me. Your room key card actually tells the elevator where to send you so there aren't floor buttons inside. Room service is delivered by Hannah- the resident robot. That's right. ROBOT. All you have to do is text what you want and up she comes.Only thing I really hated was the parking situation.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",10,"First I need to say that I am a Diamond, and before that a long time Gold. I have been to more than 50 different Hilton properties over the last 10yrs and have never seen unprofessional employees like Nataly and Elen, and subsequent the managements who are involved. I have complained in a few different directions and this review will not be end of my actions.I truly do not think this hotel, H Curio LAX, should be part of Hilton brand. Or at least the ignorant employees mentioned above should stop being associated with it. They are not only extremely unprofessional, but also their leaders are not willing to work through the issues either. To my multiple reaching outs to them regarding the issue, they never addressed the core of the issues and just offered some puny Hilton Points.I can go timeline by timeline, but here is what happened in very short version.I booked this Airport hotel for one night for August 2018. Since I was arriving past mid-night, I called them two times to confirm my reservation. If that wasn't enough I even emailed them two times to re-confirm that. I arrived at the hotel around 1:30am of Aug 8th, with my one-year old and my wife. You can imagine what it would be like to have an overnight flight with an infant year old and arriving at the hotel past midnight.By this time the hotel had cancelled my reservation, providing my room to others and fully committing their building. Now, may I remind you that I am a Diamond member who had Confirmed reservation and then re-confirmed it four times. Imagine arriving at the hotel with a stroller, car seat, four luggage, one year old fussy boy who did not get a sleep, and probably even more tired wife, and told by the hotel, WITHOUT an apology I might add, that they cancelled my reservation.They gave me all kinds of non-sense reasons that they cancelled, and the reasons were different when I contacted the leadership of Nataly and Elen. Whatever the unreasonable excuses were, this should not have happened to any guest, let alone Diamond.OK, let's say that they had a reason - Unlikely, but let's just entertain that idea. You're a hotel staff and you 'had to' cancel a Diamond member's reservation. What should you have done? The very basic thing would be to reach out to the member immediately and tell them the news, providing the new hotel and room information. Nope, none of that happened.This is not all. They missed opportunities on every step of the way. I called the front office to summon the Airport Shuttle at the airport at around 1am. Now, if you're a night staff and have a full house, and someone just called to check into the hotel at the airport, waiting for a shuttle. What do you do? It is really good time to pull out the paper work and start calling other hotels to find an availability, prepare a taxi outside, and be ready to be sorry to the arriving Diamond member. Nope. None of it happened.When I arrived they could not even find my reservation. After some fumbling they found that they cancelled mine, and then started paper work to put me, and again the amount of luggage, baby, and my wife, to another hotel after 2am. Let's say that the night staff are so incapable and so lazy that they did not even think of all these common-sensical behavior. They had the very last chance to salvage the situation: be apologetic. Nope, not happened.There are more aggravating details to this story but I am collecting more and stronger ways to complain, including going to every single social media and even reaching out to VPs in Hilton organization via LinkedIn. Wherever my journey goes to influence this hotel and get my rightful justice back, I will not stop until I am satisfied.","conation - thank you for your time in posting comments about your recent experience at our hotel, and we appreciate your continued loyalty to Hilton as a Diamond member of Hilton Honors.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",10,We checked in around midnight. The room the room felt warm on entry. We checked the thermostat and it read 76. We set the temp down and tried to adjust the fan speed. The backlighting made it impossible to see the which fan setting was sellected. There was no change in velocity of the air out of the vent when we attempted to set the fan speed. We called the desk and asked for assistance. We waited nearly an hour and and finally a security guard came. The room temp went up to 77. He repeated the exact setup that I had done and waved his arm in front of the vent and said he felt cool air. I said that I felt no change and asked him to show us how to adjust the speed. He could not and left and said he would talk with the desk person about a room shift. No call back in 20 minutes. I went down to the front desk and was told that the hotel was sold out. He offered a fan. We accepted. The fan finally arrived at 2:12 AM. We slept very poorly tossing and turning all night long. My wife checked out while I handled our bags. They gave us a $75 reduction. I was insulted by that amount and wanted to go back in and give it back to manager. My wife said that we had to get to our next flight.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",10,"As someone who travels a lot and stays at a lot of hotels...I will not stay at this hotel again. I found it to be extremely loud, I could hear the planes taking off and landing, and then went on until super late at night and started super early in the morning. The other BIG negative is the AC system. They have a motion sensored AC units in each room. I checked into a room late at night and it was very hot 76 degrees, I tried to turn on the AC, it never came on, called down to the first desk spoke with Miranda, she said she would have engineering come check, I wanted for a while, no one ever came up. I continued to hear all the plans, so decided to go back down stairs and switch rooms. I got a new room lower floor, but was told it was on a quitter side of the hospital. It however was not, and then found out about the AC's being motion censored. Engineering came up, and told me they never got a call to come to my previous room. They were not able to do anything to the AC unit. So for example if you leave for dinner, no AC, you come back to a hot room. I also asked for a fan, the engineer said no problem, he would send one up, but I never received. I called back to the desk asked again, and no one came with the fan, so at almost midnight I went to bed. I have stayed at 3 Hilton properties this week along, and have had some issue at each, the thing I notice, is they rarely apologize, and almost never offer any compensation, so I have deiced to go back to Marriott, which use to be my preferred brand.","Dear mwadew,Thank you for your review.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",20,"This property is both fine and a total train wreck. Once you get the the room it's fine - nothing special, but fine. But, before you get to that room, you have to deal with untrained staff at the front desk and total incompetence in the airport shuttle. I adhere to the rule - fool me once shame on you - fool me twice shame on me. So, when an AIRPORT hotel can't figure out how to operate an airport shuttle, it is a loser with loser management that should be fired and I'd be a moron to suffer that again.My thoughts beyond the shuttle issue -It's one building with the Homewood Suites on the lower floors and the H on the upper floors. There are two check-in desks.The desk clerk at the H must have been new - like first night new. Like, the ink isn't dry on my W-2 new. And he was alone. So I had the pleasure of watching him fumble around - at each and every step. He didn't know how to operate the computer. He didn't know that I was a HHonors member. He didn't know how to find my reservation (let alone have it ready to go when I walked up). Then he had to see my ID, then my credit card used to make the reservation...fine. I understand fraud - but when no other Hilton on plant earth needs to do that perhaps you can teach your employees the difference between someone who just walks in and asks if you have a room and someone who stays in Hilton every single week.Of course, I get to the room and it's wrong. So back down I go. This is when my luck changed. Suddenly there were two people at the H desk. They were working with another guest and the second person was trying to show the guy I had what to do. I assume someone called and told him he needed to get back ASAP. But the good news was that the Homewood Suites clerk was able to help me. She shook her head as she looked at her computer - my guess is hat she could see how the H clerk messed up. Anyway, she fixed it and everything was fine after that.There's a tip for you - if you're going to stay here stay at the Homewood side.The room itself was pretty basic. I'm not sure what the difference would be from a room on the H floors verses a room on the HW floors - except HW usually have bigger rooms.There was a bed that was a tad too soft. A long desk with the tv. A free standing amoire that was fairly small.The bathroom had two sinks with a separate shower and toilet. There was room enough for two but the lighting was pretty dim.The A/C is under-powered. It works but it struggled to cool the room - not a good sign in a new property where you can't blame engineering or maintenance for not changing the filter.The wifi was good. The hallways were quiet with good sound-proofing.There is occasional noise from LAX - especially if you are standing by the window. Probably not a problem unless you're a light sleeper.Overall - setting aside the shuttle and the desk - it was fine - nothing special but fine for an airport hotel.Now, when I read that an airport shuttle was a problem that's a huge red flag. But I wonder exactly what happened. So, here's how the H shuttle operated when I was there -I called and asked - and was told that it runs continuously. There are no set times - just head out and wait. It will come by every 20 minutes. Interestingly, the message on the hotel system says that if the shuttle doesn't show up after 20 minutes to call and let the hotel know.So, pause for a second. Hotel management knows that the shuttle doesn't show up every 20 minutes yet has done nothing to fix that? I don't want to know that I should call - I want the shuttle working so that I don't have to call. Not sure where the GM went for his hotel management education but even night school at the local community college teaches you that.So I go there and I wait. It's painted and there are signs - it's easy to find the hotel shuttle pick up point.The Hyatt Regency shuttle comes by every 3 or 4 minutes.After 7 minutes The H shuttle drives by - two lanes away from the shuttle pick up - empty - without even slowing down. I'm waving and yelling but the driver is very careful not to ever look.So I call the H. They apologize. They will call the shuttle service and a new shuttle will be sent.21 minutes later I call again - because not only has a new shuttle not arrived - for a shuttle that is supposed to arrive every twenty minutes - no shuttle has arrived for more than 20 minutes since I last called.The clerk apologizes again and says I can take a taxi and the H will reimburse me - apparently this is far from the first time they have heard this problem. (Which is how you know the problem lies with incompetent management and will never be fixed).I'm walking to go take a taxi when I see the shuttle again. Again, he's in the second lane - clearly not planning to stop. But the traffic is light so I step off the curb and bang on the van.He stops. I get in and he glares at me - apparently I've interrupted something. I soon realize that the only passenger is a woman headed to the airport and he is working overtime flirting with her. I don't know if she is his wife or girlfriend but they are speaking some language that isn't English or Spanish.When he drops her off he then sits and sulks as he stops at the other terminals. Once she got off he's honking non-stop and shouting at the other cars and alternating between hitting the gas and the brake - gas and brake over and over so the shuttle keeps lurching. The van fills with people headed to a parking deck (apparently the H shares a shuttle with a parking deck).Bottom line - it was more than a 30 minute wait for a shuttle at 10 pm. The ride to the hotel took maybe 15 minutes with heavy traffic.The next morning - the desk clerk was excellent - and the daytime shuttle driver was good. I was at the airport in 5 minutes.If your time has any value...If you tend to get frustrated by incompetence...Find a different hotel. It's LAX, there are dozens of better options.","sbccc - we appreciate your time in posting such a thorough and candid review of your stay with us, and we're sorry to hear of the issues you faced during your time here.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",20,"As a Hilton Diamond member I always look at Hilton group properties initially when requiring a hotel.The Hilton app showed this hotel at LAX, I had never stayed at a hotel from the ""Curio"" collection before and it was described as ""A brand new luxury lifestyle hotel with a unique combination of style, culture, modernity and luxury"". I thought that sounds great! The pictures on the app showed a nice bar and restaurant area, a smart gym, pool and bright bedrooms, and the crowning glory was a roof top stylish bar where you can enjoy drinks and watch the aircraft landing at LAX. As a bit of a plane buff that was really appealing and would serve perfectly after a 11 hour flight from London. The hotel was priced quite high, but with the promise of luxury I thought that would be fine.Well what a disappointment was in store!1) Staff on reception very casually dressed (to casual for a ""luxury"" hotel)2) The room was uninviting, the app shows a bright multiple window room, we had two windows with poor sound proofing for an airport hotel, and the room was quite dark.3) The roof top bar does not exist! There are seats but nothing along the scale of the photo on the Hilton App, not even a bar.4) The bar on the ground floor with the restaurant (sign on the wall says BAR) does not serve alcohol!!!5) Breakfast in the morning was not the normal Hilton buffet, it was menu items only with a very stingy $10 allowance for diamond members (normally you get free buffet cold items as a minimum)Given the false impression on the app and the cost of the room I was disgusted that a trusted brand like Hilton could portray a property which does not live up to basic hotel standards and then call it luxury is outrageous. Even if the bars had existed and breakfast had been better I have stayed at much nicer Hiltons than this!Needless to say never will I stay at a ""curio collection"" hotel again.I advise you to steer clear of this hotel.

I agree with previous reviews - the staff were at odds to say ""not my fault"" and blamed the licencing authorities. Nobody offered to suggest another bar or nearby restaurant, just ""not my fault"" .

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",30,First the good: The property is new. The rooms are modern and clean. The staff that I spoke with was friendly. We rented a Deluxe King bedroom suite. Our daughter slept on the hide-a-bed which was comfortable. The bedroom could be closed off from the living area.Now the bad: I am allergic to down. I requested a feather-free room on my reservation and called the day of check-in to ensure the room would be feather free. So many of today's alternative comforters are difficult to tell from real down. You can guess what happened. The comforter in our room was down. I ended up having a reaction to the down. The reaction generally lasts for a couple of days. I did check with the front desk after I realized what happened and they did acknowledge the mistake......a mistake I have been paying for for two days and I expect at least a day or two more.,"BobB67 - we appreciate your time in providing feedback about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear of your experience with our down linens.

"H Hotel Los Angeles, Curio Collection by Hilton",30,"This is a newly opened, redesigned hotel by Hilton, part of their ""Curio"" collection of hotels. It is attached to a Homewood Suites hotel and that is a bit confusing if you don't know this before you arrive. Also, the signage for the hotel make it a little difficult to find on busy Century Blvd. On the plus side, it is very close (about 1/4 mile) to LAX, so ideally to avoid normally heavy traffic to/from the airport. On the down side, after this extensive renovation it seems as though they did not replace the old windows with soundproof windows and we could hear each and every plane on its approach to the airport (if you do plan to stay here, please bring earplugs unless you're a very sound sleeper).The newly designed rooms are very pleasant and functional. Nice walk-in shower with sliding glass door (no more shower curtain clinging to you as you shower!). The room lighting is more decorative and not very bright. We had lots of bags to take to the room and not sure if there is bellman, but thankfully the front desk manager helped us. There are luggage carts available but don't expect assistance. It does seem that people also load those carts and keep them in their rooms at night as there were no carts available in the early morning when we departed.Lastly, please note that there are only limited hours for room service.

First, the hotel does not have its liquor license. I had to walk to the Sheraton to grab a beer with dinner. They should give guests a heads up.I few thoughts. I don’t what a Curio hotel represents. In some cities, Curio is a Hilton boutique property. In other cities it’s just a newer property. This location is the latter. It’s not a negative on the property but a negative on Hilton’s concept that is applied too broadly. The good was the breakfast, the staff, the WiFi speed, and the newness of the hotel. The negative is a lack of a liquor license, my bathroom mirrors emitted a banging sound when the lights behind them turned on, and I would argue the walls and windows are a bit thin.

The Dixie Hollywood,20,"I came south to Los Angeles from San Francisco Bay area to celebrate my birthday and to spend about a week exploring the world class art museums and culture to be found in the LA area. The staff at the motel were universally friendly. The location very close to amenities and especially the metro train. While no breakfast include, there is a nice little diner in the building complex.Now the problems-- The first night a group of three or four rooms full of students returned to the motel around 8 pm and proceeded to run up and down the motel balcony aisles shaking the building and standing out in the parking lot calling up loudly to their friends on the balconies above. They also thundered up and down the staircases all evening long shaking the building. Things settled down about 2 am but then the maids got in at 8 am pulling the noisy carts out of the storage room next to our room. The high school group checked out at about 8:30 am the next day, shouting to one another as they entered their cars. We stayed on at Dixie for another night thinking the noise makers had gone. The next night at 9 pm a different large group of noisy partiers arrived. They could been seen and heard drinking and smoking outside on the balconies and calling to friends in the parking lot below. I complained politely to the management at the front desk at about 10 pm to no avail. Noise kept up until 2am in the morning, then quiet until 5 am when we were startled awake after 3 hours sleep, by a partier outside on the balcony crying and screaming loudly (drunk?). The housekeeping carts were pulled out again at 8:00am that morning. We pulled out of there at 8:45 am, 4 days early. There were other problems with the room, the heat system in the room was inadequate in that the thermostat was in an alcove and the heat turned off before reaching the sleeping area and no extra blankets in the room, the light on the telephone was blinking constantly but the buttons were missing from the phone to turn the lights off, and finally the shower handle was loose but you could fool with it enough to get the correct water temperature. I was hoping it did not come off entirely while I was in the shower. By the way our stay- was mid week. I cannot imagine the noise could be more annoying.

The room wreaked of some air freshener that gave me a headache. The walls were peeling and had holes in the walls and ceiling. The bathroom was filthy. I didn't want to take my shoes off. The back of the door said the average nightly rate should have been $200, we paid $149. I wouldn't go back if it was $40 a night. Just awful.",Thank you for your review.

The Dixie Hollywood,30,"I choose the Dixie for its proximity to Hollywood for an event at the Dolby Theatre and its low cost. The quirky doors looked fun (but there aren’t many and i didn’t get one). The poollooked okay in the photos but was much smaller in actuality.Pros -1. Room looked modern and clean on first appearance.2. Shower had great water pressure and room was conveniently fitted with a bar fridge and a microwave and plenty of space for luggage.3. Reception helpful with storing bags and printing some stuff4. Location is great - only a 30 min walk to dolby or a quick uber ride5. Cute/quirky6. opposite Starbucks, Ralphs (open till 2am) and a Ross’s - also a good nail salon right across the road.Not so great -1. Looked under the valance in the morning as I dropped something - discovered a whole world of dust and maybe a funion and some friends. Raised this with reception who clarified that it was under the bed (like that would be okay if it was) - without much hassle they offered me a slight reduction on my rate but my advice would be to check under your valance before sleeping and if it is dirty get it hoovered before you sleep and breathe it in all night OR consider spending more on accommodation elsewhere. A few bucks in compensation doesn’t really help. Especially if you have allergies like I do.2. Soda machine broken3. The fridge was up so cold it froze my yoghurt and there were no teaspoons in the room. I mentioned this to front desk in the morning and they said i could have turned the fridge down. True, but i didn’t realise until the morning that is was Arctic inside. I had an hour spare so my yoghurt thawed and i kind of drank it. i don’t mind frozen yoghurt so no biggie there but you’d think there’d be one teaspoon maybe .....4. If you are a light sleeper, bring ear plugs as the aircon sounds like an oncoming plague of locusts. Didn’t bother me but it might bother some so come prepared.5. BYO soap unless you don’t mind the really budget stuff supplied.Overall my short stay went fine. I’m a fairly tolerant person though. I would possibly stay again due to location and nearby amenities - but would be mindful of everything i have mentioned to better manage my expectations",Thank you for your review.

The Dixie Hollywood,30,"Not fancy, and in Thai Town. Can walk to many sights (Walk of Fame and such), yet questionable safety at night. Large room that has been remodeled some, yet has work still to go. Interesting they would rent it out, though the work still needed was not a deal breaker. Free onsite parking is a huge plus, and yes, it does fill up at night, so be sure to get back early for a spot. Onsite diner was cute, though to order coffee/tea, and to have to get your own (and still pay?) was interesting, and food was good, however, make sure to ask for extra cheese, as serving is skimpy.

The Dixie Hollywood,30,"Got this room as a groupon, which was good because I wouldn't imagine spending more on a motel. The front desk was literally a table and chairs, but the receptionist was very nice. We went to our first room which was completely disgusting and looked not to be clean and she luckily moved us to another room on the second floor. Better than the first room but I think the furniture needs to be updated. Some outlets didn't work either. The website uploads the best looking pictures. Wooden fixtures were old and needed updating. Being a motel it seems kind of sketchy, but didn't have any problems at night. Might have been some homeless people rummaging through the garbage next to the pool, but they didn't pay us any trouble. Pool onsite but it wasn't open in March. Also a restaurant on site, but when I went in there for breakfast, there was no staff available. I even rang the bell and said hello. Luckily there is a Starbucks and a few other places down the road. The location was PERFECT. Very close to the Metro, which makes Los Angeles very accessible. If you are going to be busy and rarely staying in the room, this is a great place to stay.

The Dixie Hollywood,30,"Was a little surprised. While it was obviously not what was expected- it was a pleasant experience. It was clean and comfortable. The staff was a amazing. It is older and it's not a big chain, so it will have its quirks. The TV was precarious and the microwave didn't work. BUT.. the shower was hot (although not for someone over 5'6"") the toilet worked, the beds where soft. Could have used more pillows- but for a two night stay- we managed. We used Hotwire and have dubbed this as a Hotwire fail. We filtered out to 3-4 star hotels and what we got was a loose 3 star Motel. Luckily we are pretty laid back and go with the flow. Overall- I would only recommend for someone on a budget (I wouldn't pay over $100 a night) just because it's close to everything! Only a 2 mile walk to the Walk of Fame and public transportation is right on the corner. They did have a quaint restaurant on the corner- we only saw it open for breakfast- but it looked fantastic and the prices where reasonable.

The Dixie Hollywood,20,"The Dixie Hollywood is not all bad. The location is excellent and the rooms serve their purpose.You have an old flatscreen tv in every room with lots of channels. The bathrooms look newer then the rest of the rooms and the beds are comfortable.Rooms are kept clean by a very good staff. Kudos to them.We first checked in a room at the first floor, stayed one night and were allowed to change rooms and go to the second floor (recommend it. Much better). We were happy to be allowed to change rooms.But there are also a lot of drawbacks. Our main complaint is the noise during the weekend we stayed at the hotel. There was a party in one of the rooms close to us and it lasted until 4:30 am. People were drinking outside our room (the rooms open up outside - Motel Style) and the noise kept everyone awake.We and other guests called the desk to let them know what was going on, but nothing was done.Now, we know that this is not a luxury hotel. We accept the worn furniture, we accept that things aren't perfect in the room. We know what we are getting.But the main objective for Hotels is to provide the guests with a good nights rest. Where they feel safe and secure. The Dixie failed to do so in our case. The Hotel should always side with the people that are sleeping during the night, rather then those partying.We are by no means offended or mad. This is just something we want people to know before they book. People with kids shouldn't stay at this hotel during a weekend (based on our experience).But LA is a great city, the Dixie Hotel is situated nicely. There are some restaurants across the street, a few stores and stuff. It's right by the Metro line (1 minute walk).To sum it up:The Dixie Hollywood Hotel is well situated, kept clean by good employees, and has spacious rooms with good beds.But the furniture is worn, a lot of noise is transferred between rooms, there is no security to make sure that the noise level is kept down at night, the TVs are old, the plumbing at the lower level is weird (when the toilet was flushed the bathroom sink would fill up with water from below) and the hotel just needs overhaul. But that should be expected, because of the good price they offer. If the noise would be kept low this would be a good bang for the buck.","Thank you for your review.

The Dixie Hollywood,20,"NEGATIVE: I went with my family for 2 nights, when we arrived the floor was very dirty and the bed sheets looked like they weren't washed. If you or deciding to book this hotel ask to wash the bed sheets first before going. The blankets was uncomfortable and thin, there was a stain on one. When I went into the bathroom, the curtains were stained up and a large crack was on the wall. If you think this was the worse, IT got worser. 3 cockroaches was crawling inside the bathtub and there was mold everywhere.POSITIVE: The people working there was very nice and respectful.

Walking distance to the main attractions in Hollywood & close driving distance to Griffith, & Warner Bros etc. They also have free parking which is great, and I assume rare for the area.I do think the rooms could use some improvements! They need to be cleaned better, especially the floors and bathroom. The towels need to be replaced (they look old) and fixing the paint in the rooms would really make a difference.

The Dixie Hollywood,30,"The Pro's: Literally right next door to the metro, and one stop away from the Hollywood strip. $5 Uber away from the sunset strip and Griffith observatory. Pool was clean and awesome on a hot day. Right across the street from a Ross (Wife was very excited about this). Located in Thai town so lots of great Restauraunts close by. Price was also great for the area.The Cons: Upon not so close inspection you can tell this hotel may have been a dump a few years ago, unfortunately the past is glaringly obvious under nothing more than a coat of paint. I'm from Vancouver so i have no problem stepping over the homeless, but they are certainly out and about around this part of town; that being said i didn't feel unsafe or threatened at all. Although our neighbor did get arrested the second night we were there, but you cant hold that against the hotel.All in all if you're looking for a place to sleep and a pool to relax by after a long day in Hollywood at a great price this is it.

The Dixie Hollywood,30,"Ok, the positives. It is very close to a lovely breakfast cafe (right next to it), and is also opposite a good priced supermarket and takeaways (Chinese, burger, sandwich place and Starbucks). It is also really convenient for the metro system - just 1 minute's walk away. The met has disabled access (lifts) as well as escalators. The hotel is 2 stops away from the Chinese Theatre, and 3 stops from Universal Studios. There is plenty of parking if you drive there. The room has a fridge and microwave, and a coffee maker. It also has a hairdryer and ironing board. The pool is only accessible with your room key, and is fenced so it is private. The room is fairly spacious.However, there are some disappointing things. The decor is very dark. Even with the lights on (and they didn't all work), the room was dark. It wasn't helped by the furniture also being dark. Only have a shower if you don't mind showering in the dark, as when the shower curtain was shut you couldn't really see anything. Also, if you were in the room when the maids came, you missed your chance. It wasn't like other motels I have stayed in where they will call back. The towels were all a little grey rather than sparkling white, and the whole place just felt a little shabby. There was an awful stain on the phone. The area is not great - there is a lot of homeless, and unless you like Thai food (it is right on the edge of Thai town) or the burger place I mentioned before, there is nowhere to eat. The local shopkeeper warned us about pickpockets and credit card scammers too. We also found a homemade switchblade on the floor right near the outside of the hotel. I would not feel safe going back to the hotel late at night unless there was a group of us. While we were there the toilet blocked, so I went to reception to ask for help. I was given a plunger, and though the receptionist asked if I wanted help, it was obvious from the look on her face she really did not want to!It is a long way from the airport in a taxi - if you stay there, get the LAX flyway to Union Station, the the red line on the metro to Hollywood and Western. Turn right as you exit the station and the hotel is there. You can purchase 7 day metro passes for $25 plus tax which were excellent, as they include some of the buses.It is tricky whether to recommend this or not - from the location alone ie being so close to the met and some shops, and if you want to do Hollywood and Universal etc and have easy access to the met, then I would say yes, but do not expect any frills whatsoever.","Thank you for your review.

I asked the girl at the front desk one evening for suggestions for eating in the area and she told me to ""Google It"". The night before we checked out, 2 young men were breaking into the rooms.

The Dixie Hollywood,30,"We arrived to find the reception area grubby and foul smelling and the receptionist very uninterested and aloof. Took payment in advance that raised our concerns as we hadn't seen the room at that point. On opening the room door we were relieved but that soon changed as our eyes adjusted to the seedy colour painted walls, the grey bed linen and towels. All of the surfaces were sticky and the floor and storage units were chipped and tatty. On going to bed we found the pillows old and flat and covered with awful polyester covers. One of our queen beds was comfortable the other hard. VERY disappointing. Good points were, not that we were told about any of them,: the grocery store across the road in a small mall, the metro at the corner of the block, Chow's breakfast restaurant on the corner of the exit of the motel, the pool albeit murky, and the close proximity to the sites.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,20,"I booked a three night staycation. The person I spoke with in the phone during the reservation process was extremely pleasant. However, nothing she told me was true.When I recieved my email confirmation, the rate was about $20 more than what I was quoted. It also did not include the $40/night parking which the first person told was inclusive. I called back and spoke to another person and the price was adjusted back to the regular rate.I chose the Embassy Suites because I was, believe it or not, looking forward to a waffle breakfast during my staycation. Lol. In check in. I was told that the breakfast would only be a ""to go grab bag"". That was fine. I had confirmed on the phone that I would still be able to order from the restaurant. That was false. The restaurant didn't open unti 5 PM now.I've stayed at MANY Hilton/ Embassy Suites, I've always been given a water at check in or had a water in the room. Neither happened here.I don't know if the walls are just thin or if the guests were just ridiculously loud, but there was always some kind of noise going on until 2 AM. The hotel was not full. I understand that hotels are working on limited staffing but it shouldn't be to the detriment of the guest. I'm sure they can tell when 'party groups' are coming in. Put them away from the regular guests.Lastly, I have never been charged $100/night deposit for a standard hotel room. A resort? Sure. But a regular hotel? Never. Absolutely, ridiculous! Even at other Embassy Suites I've never paid $100/ night for a deposit! What is the point of that? There is no mini bar in the room. The breakfast is usually free. How does one spend $100 between lunch and dinner everyday eating in the same restaurant?On check out, I am usually asked how was my stay? Here, I was greeted with 'put the key there'.Lesson learned. Don't stay here.My positive: The 2 ladies at the restaurant made delicious Cosmopolitans (that I did not charge to the room).","Pacific-O-Kat - thank you very much for taking the time to share your review.We are pleased to hear that you received friendly service from our restaurant staff, however we are very disappointed that you were not asked how your stay was at check out.

I did not interact with the cleaning staff, but I was grateful for the work they did keeping my room tidy.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,30,"We flew in late Thursday night of MLK weekend, spent two nights, went to Dana Point to spend another night, and then came back to this hotel for the last night as we needed to be at the airport for an early flight Monday.Our first night was great. Breakfast the next morning was wonderful, as was the evening reception (on the days we went). The second night (Friday) was horrible. Even though the hotel is supposed to have “quiet hours”, and had signs at the elevator indicating that they had a “no party policy” for rooms, our room on the 8th floor had doors slamming and people in the hallway being extremely loud, yelling, and the like - until after 3 AM! Tried to call the front desk to ask if something could be done, but just kept being placed on hold with no resolution.Our second stay (Sunday night) was “okayish”. We went to take a nap and I locked our suite door with all latches and locks and then just closed our bedroom door so just in case there were loud people outside, we wouldn’t hear them. Ya - worked great until it was time to leave and we were “locked” in our bedroom as the non-locking bedroom door was stuck! After calling the desk, they had to utilize brute force to get into the room, cutting the latch off with bolt cutters I guess just to get to our bedroom door and then had to brute force that one open as well.While the handyman was awesome in getting our room open, sure would have been a nice touch for someone at the hotel to check on us, but I’m aware this isn’t the Ritz Carlton and the staff is quite busy.Parking is $44, so if possible at all, use Uber/Lyft or the Budget Car Rental place is right across the street from the Hotel.Overall? Good, clean, solid, and legit hotel with good rates except for the parking (almost half the cost of our hotel room just for the car).Lost one star for being completely unable or unwilling to control guest noise or even receive a front desk call about guest noise. Loses a second star because they didn’t contact us after we were locked in our room.","Dear FITraveler1011 -First and foremost, thank you for taking the time to write and post such a thorough review.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,20,Purchased a premium room suite and staff refused to give me the information that was exclusive to premium members (WiFi and premium snack vending). I had to go downstais 3 separate times to get my questions answered. My boyfriend called down at least 12 times to the front desk before he got an answer. We tried to order room service at 1130am and was told it wasn't avaible until 5pm. This hotel had no food options available at all so we had to order Door Dash just to eat since we didn't have a car. On check out the staff did not go over final charges and found out that the staff had charged me parking when I told them at check in that we didn't have a car.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,30,"I give them some points for being close to the airport, we were overnighting between flights and the shuttle drive was nice and didn't keep us waiting too long.I'm personally not a big fan of the courtyard style interior, I usually shut the curtains to the open walkway as soon as I get in the room. The room was nice, decent size and the bed was firm which I like.The thing that made me drop a point to Average on the rating was that outside our window on Airport Blvd the city had put down steel plates over some construction so every time a shuttle bus or truck or car drove in that lane it sounded like kettle drums at the orchestra! Thankfully traffic is less after midnight but we had a 3:15 am wake up so sleep was interrupted by all the banging of the steel plates.","Chrisinkingwood2 - we appreciate your time in providing feedback about your recent stay with us at the Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,30,"We’ve stayed here before, so we chose this hotel for our most recent visit to LA over Memorial Day weekend.Pros:- convenient to LAX; shuttle service was efficient. We arrived late into LAX but we didn’t have to wait long for the shuttle to pick us up. And same convenience for our early morning flight out of LAX- across the street from Budget car rental: made for very easy pickup and return.- spacious suites- delicious made to order omelettes and eggs at breakfastCons:- room was dirty with even a dead cockroach in the bathroom. We got there very late and we noticed the room wasn’t the cleanest (stains on table, musty smell in bathroom). The last straw was the dead cockroach. Since it was so late, I waited until the next morning to switch to another room. The new room was cleaner but we couldn’t completely shake our “ick” feeling after what we already saw. Plus, the only “compensation” the front desk offered was free parking but then she noticed my room rate had a parking package (“oops, never mind.”)- breakfast: while the made to order omelettes/eggs were good, everything else was kind of a mess. I think it was because the hotel wasn’t prepared for the holiday weekend crowds so the staff was feverishly working to keep up with the mess people were making. At one point, we were so disgusted because one of the cereal dispensers was broken so we saw multiple people take off the lid from the dispenser and use their bare hands to scoop out the fruit loops. We told the worker but the dispenser wasn’t fixed. Then, another very strange thing, we saw a woman pour a cup of coffee into the oatmeal pot.Based on this latest stay, I think we’re going to try a different hotel the next time we stay at LAX.","alicel803 - thank you for your time in posting comments about your recent stay with us, and we appreciate your continued loyalty to the Embassy Suites LAX North.

They pick up from multiple hotels and they pick up arrivals/drop off departures simultaneously as they make their way through LAX. We were dropped off by baggage claim. The driver was not helpful at all when we asked where to find wheelchair assistance for my mother or to be dropped off closer to the check in counter where we had a wheelchair reserved.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,30,"I booked directly with the hotel by calling them and they booked me for 2 separate rooms and charged me for a no show! After staying at the hotel and returning home, I noticed an additional $260 fee on my charge card and when I called the told me this was for a NO SHOW fee - did I mention I stayed there and booked directly with them???? I explained to the rep and he told me there was nothing he could do- I would need to try to speak with Accounting to see if they could make an exception. I found this to be terrible customer service- not only did the initial rep make a mistake on my hotel reservation and they charged me but to even allude that it may be a problem getting my money back just made me even more frustrated.Next concern was the DISGUSTING bedding that was included in the couch rollout bed - that housekeeping clearly forgot to change. After returning from a long day out with the kids at almost 11pm we were all exhausted an ready for bed. My daughter made up the couch bed and when I came out and seen the nasty spots all over the blanket - I almost threw up. How gross- I called the front desk and after an hour they finally brought some new sheets- no blanket just a sheet. I was too tired to even complain. The next day - housekeeping came back and had the nerve to fold those dirty blankets back up!!!!! I purposely put them on the floor in a corner so she would know to not do this. The same housekeeping staff must have been exhausted or in a rush as she left her cleaning supplies in the shower- go figure.The breakfast staff was nice and courteous.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,10,"We booked 2 nights at this airport hotel before flying back home and I am writing this review from the hotel after my first night - so take into consideration that more negative could happen! But I just cannot wait to share how bad our first part of the stay has been!!!! From the moment we walked into the hotel, this was just the worst stay on hearth. I went to the front desk and asked for a luggage porter, they said we had to wait as there wasn’t any right now. Seems like I was bothering them by asking! We had to end up unloading all our suitcase at the front of the hotel ourselves.We booked 2 rooms, one of them consisting of 2 underage children (age of the children written on the booking prior to checking in). We requested connecting rooms, and they said they can’t provide that. After insisting, we managed to get rooms on the same floor. I had also sent an email to the hotel hours before checking in, explaining what we needed, checkin and checkout times, etc... I told the front desk agent and she was like “oh yeah, you sent an email?” truly, nobody cared, and over a day after I still didn’t get a response which doesn’t surprise me!One of the rooms was for 3 persons (double bed and pulled out sofa bed) but there were only towels and bathroom amenities for 2 people in the room... Sofa bed wasn’t made for the 3rd person (of course, what should I expect?!) so we desperately called Housekeeping, who never picked up, and ended up calling the front desk 5 times until someone finally responded. I asked the male employee to send someone for amenities, towels and making the sofa into a bed. The housekeeper entered the room while I was in the bathroom, but to my surprise, she didn’t make the sofa bed.... I called the male agent again and he said to me “you should be reminding the housekeeping lady about making the sofa bed when she comes in”..... What? Sorry, no!!!!! Communicating with your staff is not my job. So the housekeeper came again, opened the sofa, threw a sheet on, then said the bed was made. I asked her why my little sister was not getting any pillows to sleep on, and she said “oh you also need pillows?”... I mean, who sleeps without pillows? I then also had to ask for a duvet/blanket as she didn’t plan to provide any but it was cold in the room due to air conditioning. Waste of time and energy with the most lazy staff on earth!Oh and I almost forgot to mention the noise in the room! So you would expect an airport hotel to be thinking about soundproof windows right? Well they didn’t. We heard every airplane landing and departing, from evening to morning.... We didn’t sleep all night. What’s a hotel for, if you can’t sleep?! Isn’t that the main purpose?!We paid 340$ per room per night (2 rooms x 2 nights) but this hotel is nowhere near worth this! Avoid. Abort mission. Go to the Marriott, at least they have standards and don’t make a fool of their guests!The Embassy appears to be understaffed, and the ones that work there are lazy, lack of standards, training and have no passion at all for their job. No management presence at any time.We are never coming back again, and will definitely spread the word about how bad this was!","Emily_Sbg - we appreciate your time in providing feedback about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear of your experience.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,10,"This location is awful. They don’t care about regular customers when their lobby is jam-packed with people from whatever event they were hosting. Well, I’m a Hilton Diamond member and I don’t expect to be treated like a criminal when I walk up to the evening reception. They actually make you scan your room key and won’t let you get two drinks (one for self and one for wife) but if you both go stand in line, you’ll lose your table in the crowded lobby. If you’re going to make me scan my key, you should know how many people are in my room. Complaints about this were brushed off and blamed on another department. This hotel has the worst staff ever. I’ll spend my money elsewhere. (By the way, the Sheraton across the street has a very nice bar/restaurant, with delicious food and helpful staff.)","AdamLex - thank you for your time in posting comments about your recent stay with us, and we appreciate your continued loyalty to Hilton as a Diamond member.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,10,From the first time we arrive at the embassy suites we received our room as I was in my electric chair I went into the bedroom and I noticed something was dripping on me I looked up and there was colored liquid drippin on me I was told that was free on from the maintenance .We ask for another room we were told that room 830 was available.so we looked at room 730 and was told that it was the same as room 830.We told the front desk when we get back from doing vacation stuff that night we would move over from room 831 to room 830.We get back to the room begin to move our stuff from room 831 to room 830when I turned on the air condition I noticed that it was blowing heat instead of cold room service came up and knocked on room 831 and said that he was there to clean the room.I told him about the air condition problem in room 830 he told me he would get maintenance up there to fix the problem so we waited and waited until the front desk called I said why we haven't moved yet.I begin to tell the front desk lady that the reason why we didn't move yet is because the room service gentleman told us that he was getting the maintenance the fix the air condition or look at the air condition and that was 45 minutes ago then the front desk person told me that the maintenance went home for the night.Then I told her well why didn't the room service guy tell me this was happening and made us wait 45 minutes until the front desk called to tell me that the maintenance person went home for the night.Then the front desk person said that she would have security come up and help me move I told her that I am very mad about waiting 45 minutes for maintenance and then to find out that maintenance went home for the night that I would refuse any help from the hotel at this point because I'll be yelling and screaming at somebody and I didn't want to do that.And I told the front desk that I would be down at the front desk with the room keys for room 830 after I move my stuff from room 830 back to room 831 I said if I'm going to be miserable I'm not going to be miserable in a little room I rather be miserable in a larger room because that was the only option for me.So not only 5 minutes after I hung up the phone with front desk lady I heard a knock at the door at room 830 I answered the door and it was security he said that front desk sent me up here to help you move I told him five minutes ago I told the front desk I didn't need your help and I refuse to our help from anyone from the hotel on moving my stuff and I would be downstairs after I move all my stuff to give her the room keys for room 830 after I finish moving two room 831 so I told the security to go back down to the front desk lady and tell her I did not need your help for the second time I told her.So not even 10 minutes later I hear a knock at the door again then the door Bell was ringing constantly I yelled out and said that I'm in my underwear give me a chance to put something on I'll be right there very loudly.All the sudden the door burst open someone saying front desk and security it was the lady and the security guy I talked to standing there looking at me with the door wide open with my underwear on nothing else and everybody outside the door looking at me across the hall with my underwear on don't do the voice they have the door open for at least 5 minutes they understood me screaming at them to close the damn door and that I repeated myself that I would come downstairs after I move my stuff back into room 831 finally they close the damn door.No longer after half an hour moving my stuff not everything but almost everything I got a call and I call from front desk saying when are you going to be finished moving I'm sick of tired of waiting I said to the front desk lady that I will be downstairs when I am finished moving my stuff and I said to her you're acting like I'm trying to steal everything in your stupid room leave me alone until I'm finished thank you and I hung up.So about 20 or 25 minutes later I went downstairs gave a different front desk lady the room keys to room 830 and I told her what had transpired and then all the sudden the same security guy Etsy me and my underwears with the front desk lady came around the corner and I asked them what did I tell you when you came up and said you were there to help me move he said that you didn't need my help and to go downstairs and tell the front desk lady the same thing.Then I said to the security guard what did the front desk lady say to you after you told her what I told you the security guard said she then told me the company her up to my room 830why the heck did you guys hold the door open for everybody to see me in my damn underwears and you guys stood there watching me and my underwear he had nothing to say about it that it was the front desk lady that ordered the whole thing.The next day I called Hilton corporate office on Hilton honors members and I begin to tell the lady what had transpired at this location and that no one at this hotel has offered to help if it's anything or help me go to another Hilton location nor did the manager reach out to us to help.we were told that our bill will be taken care of because of the incidence from another front desk lady only told this to the Hilton corporate office also.We told the Hilton corporate office when we checked out that not only did the manager of the embassy suites hotel did not get back to us or help us in any way after we talked to you or when we checked out that we were very upset about this whole ordeal.The corporate office of Hilton honors reach back to us and said that they would be able to give us 60000 points or two free rooms anywhere in the world at any Hilton location.And that that's the only thing they can do for us so we pick the two free rooms just for the inconvenience and it had nothing to do with the bill because we thought it was being taken care of from the front desk.Come to find out the front desk people lie to us all along from when it first happened to when we checked out.The other thing is and other guests were complaining about it is that the free breakfast they give it was like being in the freaking army they only gave you two pieces of bacon with the eggs but they always wanted the tip everywhere you looked around there was a freaking tip jar.I wanted to tell him don't play the freaking horses for a tip.The breakfast was a joke the danishes that they put out there was more fruit flies in there than danishes and muffins.When it came to closing their was so rude and fast to close down everything and shut everything in the customer's face then they'll let everybody get their breakfast before they close for the daythis is the only embassy suites that I have seen this done.,"joe c - thank you for your time in providing feedback about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear of all the confusion that took place.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,20,"The room we were given had an A/C problem that was leaking pink fluid on the carpet. The front desk let us check out other rooms to move to but, there was hardly any air coming out of any of the A/C vents in those other rooms. We finally were able to move to the room next to our original. While moving our things, the front desk sent up security as if were stealing something. Then later on security came back up with the front desk agent and barged in on my friend while still moving our things. He was in his underwear at the time and they stood there with the door open and watched him move about the room in his underwear. I called Hilton Corporate Headquarters to complain because nobody at the hotel seemed to care about the guest.The breakfast here is lacking in comparison to other Embassy Suites. You are only given (2) pieces of bacon/sausage. They regulate the bacon/sausage like you are in the military. The selection of items are slim and they wait until something is all gone to replenish the item. The evening reception selection is ok but I have had better breakfasts and reception selections at other Embassy Suites. You could feel the cheapness; like they were offering things because they had to at the bare minimum.When you ask for extra towels/washcloths, if you do not use all of them; the next day housekeeping takes the un-used towels/wash cloths back. Then you have to call back down to ask for more towels.The elevator floors were dirty and in need of a mopping.The (2) Front Desk agents (Ernesto and Santiago) were great assistance.","RClarkTravlr - we appreciate your time in providing feedback about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear of you and your friend's experience at our hotel.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,30,Overall our stay at the hotel was ok. However it felt as if the hotel experienced some difficulties in the past regarding the complementary breakfast and managers reception. Breakfast was limited on items and you had to ask for the beacon and/or sausage from the made to order section. During the managers reception you were only allowed one drink at the time with the drinks being about 4 ounces each.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,20,"We arrived at 10pm on a very rainy night to find that parking was $40 per night. This was the first of many unpleasant surprises that occurred during this short stay. When i requested a diamond upgrade at check in I was eagerly obliged only to realize that we were not upgraded at all. The entire reason for the stay was a flight at 11pm on the following night.... after check in, Saturday. Our plan was to spend the day visiting a local attraction, come back to the room freshen up and head to the airport around 8 pm. When I approached Brenda and asked if this was possible, she said the cost would be $85. No problem. Upon our return from our activity at 430 we found ourselves locked out of our room. We were told that our late check out for $85 ended at 6pm. We were effectively paying $85 to store our luggage for the day. To make matters worse, we had returned our rental car so we had no choice but to head for the airport 6 hours prior to departure. There must be better choices in and around LAX.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,20,"Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North is the most poorly managed Hilton property In which I have stayed in as long as I can remember. The building is architecturally stunning, the rooms are nicely appointed, and the proximity to LAX is essential.In our lovely suite, the safe was locked in the open position and unusable, at least one electric outlet wouldn’t work, and worst of all, the alarm clock was not re-set to off, waking my wife up in the middle of the night. These are all checklist items for cleaning staff. Don’t blame staff, though, it’s poor supervision and training from management.At breakfast, the fruit was inedible, they were out of orange juice (in California?), and there was no yogurt. The omelette station was excellent.As a Hilton Honors member, I stay at Hilton properties all over the world, because I depend on Hilton quality. They guarantee it.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,30,"Some trips scream bad karma: (1) my first room the a/c didn’t work, (2) changed rooms and the second room developed a leak in the bathroom in the morning, and (3) room number 3 seems to be okay. I understand that maintenance issues arise and it falls into the category of bad karma. Breakfast was okay — or average. Notwithstanding bad karma and average breakfast, there is NO REASON to put the manager’s happy hour bar on one side of the building and the chips, salsa, popcorn, and (very few) veggies on the opposite side of the building.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,30,"A solid, typical Embassy Suites that was comfortable and had plenty of space.The bathroom seemed partially renovated with some nice, thoughtful touches, but the work wasn’t high quality. While sitting on the toilet, you could easily see the line of the old wallpaper and how it all didn’t properly align with the new tile. The sink area seemed slightly dated given the update to the shower. As seems to be the trend lately, the tub is gone replaced with just a shower. This one was in many ways one of the nicer ones I’ve been in. The flooring had good texture to keep you from falling. There was a place both for a bar of soap as well as for several bottles - something that’s often a struggle in hotels to find a shower with space for all products. The one thing I wish they had done was rather that one stationary shower head, that they went with a dual head with rain as well as handheld.The room was comfortable and what you expect from Embassy Suites, a good king size bed, with a separate room with a desk, and couch. The bedroom part had a window to the outside that looked over a loading dock and trash area for another hotel. The room was clean and comfortable.The evening reception was disappointing and disjointed. In the breakfast area you had some veggies, popcorn, chips and salsa. Tried the chips and they weren’t good, stale maybe? On the other side was the restaurant where I made the mistake of getting the free glass of wine, I didn't have high hopes going in, but it was undrinkable. The breakfast was better and standard fare for Embassy. At first I was a bit confused as to why there was no bacon or sausage for breakfast. Thankfully the person working the omelette station saw me and asked if I wanted some, he had it in his station, I guess so people don’t go crazy with it?Parking at all of the hotels near the airport is very expensive. There's just enough room at the entrance of the hotel for one or two cars while you're checking in, the space is very tight as it also serves as the stop for the shuttle. There is some metered street parking near the hotel but there’s a time limit and the meters don’t shut off till midnight. We parked on the street for a few hours and then ended up dropping off our rental and walking back to the hotel. (Some but not all the rental companies are in walking distance.) We took the shuttle to the airport, it pretty much runs continuously on a loop. We got lucky and caught it right when we went downstairs. It made a stop at another hotel before getting to the airport, but was fairly quick and since it was free, made it easier than calling an Uber.Overall, this is more than sufficient for a night before flying out, but if I were to stay several days, I'd probably find a different hotel.","MySobriquet,Thank you so much for taking the time to write such a detailed review.

It stared when I called on the day we were scheduled to drive up and stated I wanted to let them know we would be arriving a bit late and wanted to change my card on file (had used my ATM wanted to use Visa) The individual stated, ""Ok I will cancel your reservation"" I said NO, I just wanted you to know we are arriving a bit late and to change my card on file. He then asked for my card number, twice, verified it and stated it was done. Right when we got ready to leave, I used the HH app to verify and found my reservation was cancelled all together. Panicked called and spoke to a woman who stated they DO NOT ask for credit card number over the phone, and that she would try and see if there was room availability.I was very upset, she then came back and said there was a room. I asked her why I was asked for my credit card number and that would they check and see who asked for it and what happened? she said they would. If I had not asked these questions I would not have been told anything. I then said, you seem irritated and that I just want an apology as a long time loyal customer. She reluctantly gave it.Get to the hotel, The young man behind the counter looked at us without any greeting. I went up and said hello, he said do you have a reservation?

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,20,"We have completed a four week holiday in both California and Orlando. This was our last night at LAX prior to flying to Australia with two small children.ProsSpacious and clean room, that was good for repackaging luggage. Also clean and comfortable. The customer service was good at reception. Free shuttle service although grumpy shuttle driversConsUnfortunately more downsides of this hotel and would not recommend for family visits.The pool is dirty with quite a lot of mound around, as well as not heated. So kids swam for a small time before getting too cold.Very corporate feeling hotel and we did not feel our children were welcome here particularly in the restaurant.This hotel is very noisy and you can hear planes or major road noise easily, so not good if you are a light sleeper. Also a lot of corridor noise. I looked for double glazed windows but they didn’t feel or appear to be. I often stay at Parkroyal Melb airport and can not hear the planes here.The parking price is terrible - 32USD plus tax. We used it because we could not drop our car off that nightBreakfast buffet is good but be warned it closes immediately at 9am on weekdays whether there are customers or not. Service staff are not interested in giving a spoon after 9am much less letting you get a piece of toast.However, a Elsa the omelette lady made us an a wonderful omelette for my girls at 9.05. So many thanks for her kindness.In summary, I would not stay here again with my family. Too corporate and too noisy.We stayed at Embassy Suites LAX south when arrived in LA and would recommend this hotel instead and which we had stayed here instead.","Hamshols - thank you for your time in posting comments about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear that you were not 100% satisfied with your stay.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,20,"When I arrived at the hotel, it was before check in time. Upon making my reservation, I stated that I would arrive around 9 am and was told that was fine. The hotel staff refused to allow my family and I to check into the hotel early after we traveled 24 hours in a car from Oklahoma. Staff kept saying that no rooms were available and we had no choice other than to sit in the lobby (looking pathetic) as hotel guest checked out. It was really embarrassing! I informed the staff that we had an event to attend that we needed to get dressed for and they seemed to not care at all. I contacted another Embassy that was on the other side of Los Angeles who informed me that the procedure for early check in was to expedite the cleaning of a room and they would be more than willing to do so for my family. Unfortunately, our event was too far from the other hotel location. After waiting in the lobby for a couple of hours with tired children who had slept in a vehicle overnight, I decided to call the corporate office. They placed a call to the front desk while I was on hold (still waiting in the lobby) and about 20 mins later we were allowed to check into a comfortable hotel room. I do not understand why the manager and staff refused to let us check in when they had the availability to do so. I have stayed at Embassy Suite locations in several states and this location did not provide a warm welcome.","mrsknighten - we appreciate your time in posting comments about your recent stay with us, and we're sorry to hear that you were not 100% satisfied with your stay.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,30,"1. The owner of the franchise doesn't want to spring for an Embassy Suites airport shuttle bus, so they share one with the Residence Inn across the street. We waited for nearly an hour and a half while watching Hilton, Renaissance, Hyatt, and Westin shuttle buses passing us over and over. Finally, the Westin guy stopped, opened the door, and asked us which shuttle we were waiting for. I guess he thought we were lost (ha)!2. If you want meat for breakfast (bacon or sausage), you have to wait in a usually long line (the same line where they make the omelettes). If you've got plenty of time, I guess this is okay; but many business people are on a schedule and don't want to waste time standing in a line to get a link or two of sausage.3. The TVs are rigged so you can't play your own movies from your phone or PS3. When you try to plug into the HDMI port on the TV, you get a message after changing the input that says the function ""isn't supported."" Not supported? How stupid do they think we are? A simple TV from Costco or Walmart has a working HDMI input. Geesh! We've run into this TV-rigging problem at some Marriotts, but seldom at a Hilton property. They want you to buy their in-house movies. But this is a short-sighted and worn-out revenue-producing strategy. Fortunately, most hotels in this technological age don't do it anymore. They've learned to play ball with their customers who prefer to use their own devices.One bright spot in our visit, however, was Justin at the front desk. He knew how long we had waited for the airport shuttle and he very kindly offered us a $50 voucher for a meal at the restaurant. We appreciated it very much and the meal was great. The chef there knows what he's doing!","Mpradio - thank you for your time in providing feedback about your recent stay with us, and we appreciate your kind words about Justin and the front desk. Regarding the airport shuttle, LAX mandates that hotels share their shuttle service with another entity, whether that's another hotel or a parking lot operator.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,30,"I stay at this hotel numerous times during the year as part of my business travel. Visiting in June, means I have to deal with the vacationers which can be trying anywhere. I usually book a non-suite room or cheapest available and receive an automatic upgrade t or before check-in as a Hilton Diamond member. This trip, I arrived at 9pm local time and was not awarded an upgrade in advance. At chech-in, the desk clerk was surprised by my request for an upgrade because I booked a lower cost room. She wasn't really listening and didn't really care. Disappointing, but the room itself was fine. Getting there you had to proceed to the staff room and turn left. I almost turned around as it appeared I was in an area for housekeeping.After a good nights sleep, I went for breakfast at 8am and there was a line of 17 people waiting to place their orders with 1 person cooking. So skip the eggs and look what else was available ...not much. They were pretty much out of everything. A few employees wandering around but only one working and doing a fine job. At check-out the desk agent asked how was everything and relayed the story while her supervisor was standing just a few feet away looking at another computer. She expressed her apology by adding points to my stay which was fine but the supervisor never raised her eyes though she wasn't dealing with anyone. That is my last time there.

Embassy Suites by Hilton LAX North,30,We waited well over an hour for the LAX shuttle to arrive. The reason we chose to stay here was to rest between a late flight into LA and an early and very long flight the next morning so the long shuttle delay was really a bad first impression and major waste of time for the 22+ very angry customers and luggage piled into the shuttle.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro,10,"Have stayed there multiple times and usually a nice experience. But Saturday night, I was put in a room over an event space that had a party with bumping music until midnight. When I called, the night management was not empathetic at all, telling me “nothing can be done”. As I had to wake up at 4:30am for work, I was pretty bummed. It was so loud, I could actually tell what songs were playing. The night manager also told me that there were 4 parties going on, so much of the hotel rooms were experiencing this challenge.It’s obviously a design flaw, and the hotel has made the decision that revenue for parties is more important than their guests getting sleep.If you choose to stay here, make sure you ask if there are any event rooms near or under your room. It’s a nice clean comfortable place but this cavalier attitude and design flaw isn’t becoming of the Hilton brand.","Hello!

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro,20,"My family stayed at the hotel for 1 night before a cruise, and had booked a 1 bedroom suite as there were 5 of us (3 younger kids). Upon getting to the room we found out that a it wasn't actually a 1 bedroom, but 1 bed around a wall from the tv/ couch area. Also, the couch isn't a fold out, there are none in the hotel. I wad told there are no actual doored bedroom type rooms in this hotel, so the description is deceiving. Also, there was no bath/shower combo as listed in the room description, only a walk in shower. Another issue the next morning were a lot of ants in the sink/ mini fridge area, that had found the left over cookie we recieved upon checkin. Mind you this was on the 2nd floor so that's a problem. I told the hotel about that and they hopefully addressed it.As for the next day and going to the cruise, we did park at the hotel and took a shuttle to the port. It's a pretty short drive, and fairly convenient. The shuttle books up fast so make your reservation as early as possible. They were very helpful with the shuttle to/ from the port, and there were no issues leaving our car at the hotel while away.Overall because of the room I booked, and the issues with the room, it was too expensive mainly based on not getting an actual 1 bedroom and the other shortcomings and issues. Also they were sold out, so moving to a smaller room was a bad option. In the future I'd opt for a different hotel, or at least confirm ahead of time to ensure everything was as described.","Good afternoon,Thank you so much for taking the time to share your experiences with in regards to your recent stay.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro,20,We had read great things about this hotel. Reserved a room for 10/4/18 specifically for a Marina view the night before a cruise. Chose this hotel for that reason. Paid extra. Upon arrival the hotel did not honor our reservation for a marina view. We were bumped by a bunch of Chinese airline employees and put in room overlooking the dumpster. There were 2 other people in line with same issue. I never would have paid this much for a room if I knew this would happen. The Front Desk employee - Riley (refused to provide last name) and the Manager Frank were not accommodating at all. Very snotty and not helpful. They blamed it on the fact that I booked through Chase Travel instead of directly through the hotel. They offered an $80 credit which I have yet to see. I knew it would not happen. Very disappointing.,"I understand that you have lost confidence in our hotel based on this experience, but I'm hoping you will offer us another opportunity in which to serve you to DoubleTree's true standards.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro,10,"Needed a room for one night pre-cruise. Wanted to stay in a nice place and decided on Doubletree by Hilton San Pedro. Bought a room through my Chase Sapphire Reserve travel portal. Paid the highest price listed for this hotel on the portal. Had a written confirmation stating I paid for a Large King room with Harbor Views, and a furnished balcony. When I got there to check in the person in front of me was having a problem with getting a room that he paid for. I was assigned my room and I asked the person at the desk if it was a Harbor room with a furnished balcony. he said no. I showed him the written confirmation and he said that they have no good rooms left. He was rude and totally not helpful. Asked to speak to a manager he wouldn't do anything. They said that I reserved through a third party and they don't honor their room requests only if you book directly through Hilton. I was told that there were no other rooms available, I went on the Hilton website later that evening and it would let me book a Balcony room with view. There was another party traveling with me who also bought the room the same way I did and had a confirmation for a Harbor view room, they got a bad room as well. My room which I paid top dollar for was the worst room on the property, it was the last room furthest from the main desk looking at parked cars and an empty pool. This room was a very long walk from the main desk. It appears that Doubletree by Hilton sells the prime rooms threefold and then does not honor the written contract, they offered me free breakfast but I get that anyway as being an Hhonors Gold member. Do not book Doubletree by Hilton San Pedro.","I understand that you have lost confidence in our hotel based on this experience, but I'm hoping you will offer us another opportunity in which to serve you to DoubleTree's true standards.

We didn't get the room we paid for and when the clerk kept trying to give us an upgrade the other clerk would interrupt her and stop her from giving us something we thought we had paid for. Very rude to do in front of the customer! We had ants in our bathroom; the door to our room wouldn't close properly; the walls are thin where you can hear everything from the floor above you and next to you. When we complained - nothing happened. The bartender was not friendly at all and doesn't deserve to be working in an environment like that. She was more concerned about her smoke break than treating customers in a friendly manner. There was constant pounding outside that the front desk said they could do nothing about. Then a fire alarm goes off in the middle of the night for about 3 minutes! A high price hotel that we paid for with low price accommodations and customer service!

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro,10,"I scheduled a room block for my wedding at the DoubleTree by Hilton San Pedro and from the beginning I didn't have the customer service I usually expect from the Hilton brand. First, I did not receive timely responses from the catering manager regarding the status of my block. Then the link provided by the hotel stopped working and 12 of my guests booked elsewhere because not only did the link NOT WORK for at least 3 days, but the hotel didn't even give us the best rate possible. People booked through alternate means (i.e. Hotels.com, expedia, etc) and got a much better rate than what was provided. These days were crucial booking days as they were close to the cut off and people assumed that since the link didn't work they had to book elsewhere. When the link FINALLY worked - people had already booked hotels. The manager's response was to have people call when she finally called me back. Too late.... I think the most disappointing part of all of this was the guests that I booked the hotel for myself were unable to check in without me. Upon my check in I told them the other rooms that I booked with the same card and I basically checked in for them. I was told they would just need to show up and they would be given room keys. Not only did this not happen, but my out of town guests had to call me and I had to come down and show MY ID and CARD which I had already done which further delayed my guests after their traveling.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro,10,"My partner and I booked 7 nights here for a business trip. We are halfway through and it has been a disaster.We are Hilton Honored Guest member and always stayed in those HH rooms when we stay in Hilton. During check-in, we asked if we could have the HH room, and they said they were all booked. When we arrived the 2nd floor, we found that there are plenty of HH rooms in the 3rd floor, so my partner went down to the front desk to ask HH room again. Then we got moved to a HH room. Why don't they just give us the HH room at first? Is it a fun game, ha-ha-ha?There is no restaurant around within walking distance, and the no in-room food available between 11am and 5pm. Yes, they don't serve lunch over the weekdays. The only thing edible are candies and cold sandwiches in the fridge. Seriously? I work from the hotel and had to order delivery every day for lunch. There ain't any good option, neither. Oh, did I mention that they don't have fridge nor microwave in the room? I end up ordering Soylent from Prime Now for lunch for a couple of days.Can I just stuff myself with breakfast so that I can sustain over the lunch? No. Because the breakfast was awful. Always the same 5 for hot plates: mushy waffle, tasteless scrambled eggs, tasteless scrambled eggs with small pieces of bacon or some type of meat, terrible breakfast potato, and uncooked or overcooked sausage/jerky-like bacon. Then you have oatmeal, boxed cereal, fruit, some bakery stuff, milk, small yogurt, and condensed juice. They serve coffee to you - means you have to ask for coffee. Can't get it on your own.Not to mention I can clearly hear the people watching TV next room. I can clearly hear the dialogs from the TV. They have two dogs in the room and was barking crazy all day long.Also... all of the housekeeping staff are off at 4pm. Which means if you need any service after 4pm, sorry but no one can help you.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro,30,Stayed here for it's location in the area of Palos Verdes and Long Beach. It's in the Cabrillo Marina which berths several hundred yachts and motorized watercraft. There is a very pleasant waterfront walk and it is close to Cabrillo Beach where there's a sea wall walk and a children's playground. It's also close to the cruise passenger port.Now to the hotel - the rooms are comfortable and relatively newly appointed and we had a marina view which was awesome. Rooms are good.However the bar and restaurant let this place down completely. Cheap and under equipped. The bar not much more than a counter with a sink and a few bottles thrown on the counter and four taps of beer. Very unsophisticated and no cocktail list or trained bar man so to speak. Yes they could poor a drink but so can I. With a Resort in front of the name then it should be Resort standard bar and service. It's not. The bar man was jack-of-all trades. No fault of his but really Hilton???The bar food and restaurant was the same - ordinary to say the least.If this place could spruce up the bar and restaurant it would attract more synergy. Put in place a few classy trained bar tender mixologists and a top chef and you'd have something. A barista in the mornings would be great too. Food less fried - drinks less ordinary with better glassware - the patio would be a nice touch if it were more open as well. Spruce up this location Hilton.

They told me pretty much I'm stuck with the room with a bill. They also told me that if I turn my head 90 degrees to my right I will be able to see the pool, I did and I saw the corner of the pool. My room view is right in front of the trash enclosure.Room wasn't ready when I checked in and had to wait 3 hours.WiFi doesn't connect and clearly says that there is no internet connection.They will say everything you want to hear until they lock you in with the bill.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro,30,"Website planning pictures does not reflect this property. This hotel was older and not as nice as represented on the website. Rooms did not have microwaves or refrigerators. We call the front desk and asked for a microwave and they offered to bring a portable one to our room. We accepted the offer but felt it was strange that the rooms did not have these appliances. Also, the sliding bathroom doors took some getting use to but showed the outed nature of this hotel. We did try the restaurant. The food was fresh and hot but a little pricey. Lastly, the area in which the hotel is located is very nice. It is located directly by the port overlooking the pier. This was a nice touch. Overall, we would stay here again. But we now know what to expect.","Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro,30,"We stayed at this hotel for 2 nights. Check in was easy and the room was fine. We were leaving on a cruise upon checkout with the hotel transferring us. The first night we ate in the hotel restaurant food was good, beer was warm with no explanation. On order in the second beer we asked for a cold one and was told the cooler was broken but would cool a couple down in the kitchen. The hotel overlooks the marina which is a lovely walk that we took & came back for happy hour. They finally had put beer into ice and we found out the cooler had not worked in months and they hadn't figured out to put beer on ice for customers???? The next day we took the free shuttle available to all customers to go to the battleship IOWA for a tour, called the hotel to be picked up and the driver came and took us out to the Target so we could shop and have a look around. It was 2:50. We shopped and walked around for a while and called the hotel about 4:00. We were then told that the shuttle was unavailable until 6:00 because they were busy with cruise customers checking in. This is the first we heard about them not being available at certain times. Had to pay for a taxi back. Not impressed, had we been told we would not have gone shopping at all. The shuttle did manage to get us to the cruise terminal. Would not recommend this hotel.",Thank you for sharing this honest feedback. We are pleased to hear that you enjoyed the food. I am so sorry about the temperature of the beer.

DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel San Pedro,30,"I chose this hotel due to its location. My husband and I were attending a conference in Long Beach and weren't able to find a hotel there that would allow our dogs to stay. This hotel was nice enough although I would not say it was excellent. We stayed in room 288. I'll start with the Pros...Front desk staff were incredibly friendly and helpful. Our AC was making funny noises and we called the front desk to help with that and they sent someone right away. The maintenance worker was very kind and was able to sort the issue out for us. Each employee I had interaction with was very friendly! Great customer service all around. The price was reasonable for the area although I would not pay it again. Location was great, it wasn't far from where our conference was being held and right on the marina which was lovely. Parking was easy, we have a large truck and had no trouble at all. The gym was nice.The cons...The smell in the hallways and stairways was almost unbearable. The bathroom in our room had a horrible smell as well, luckily I had some bathroom spray to neutralize it. The bathtub drain was broken and did not hold water so baths were not an option. The sliding bathroom door needs to go! I suggest getting a real door. Bathroom needs more towel hooks for hanging towels. The AC was loud even after maintenance tried to fix the issue. But I have to say the most disappointing was the over priced room service. The food was AWFUL! Wifi isn't free.Overall we enjoyed our stay.",Thank you so much for providing this valuable feedback.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"My fiancee & I stayed 2 nights a few days apart during my graduation trip. Location is close to the airport & car rentals. The free parking & shuttles were super helpful. Rooms were small but clean & adequate for the brief time we spent in them. Rooms were quiet despite the proximity to the airport. The air-conditioner unit are a bit loud but if you like some white noise when sleeping, it wasn't a big issue. The included breakfast was good & had many choices. Snacks, drinks & convenience items were available at a reasonable price. On our 1st day staying, we checked in before the 3:00 check in time because our plane got in early. We were prepared to wait to check in, but they accommodated the early check in without even flinching! We were a bit disappointed about the pool & hot tub being closed during our stay due to renovations & we didn't know until after we checked in. We felt that a huge portion of the hotel being closed didn't really quite justify the price we payed per night, but then again we were in LA so the price wasn't awful, we just wished there had been more relaxing things to do @ the hotel other than sit in your room.

The clerk told me there was a deposit for the room and I asked him what it was for He told me the snacks that they sell at the desk. He told me they release the deposit 3 to 5 days after you check out. I understand deposits but why they need to keep them for up to 5 days I dis not understand.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"For the money I paid, I would have expected a shuttle to take me from the airport. We waited for 30 minutes and ended hopping on the Holiday Inn shuttle, but the other one. Thankfully the nice lady driver took us to the HI Express, but if it were up to the hotel, we would still be waiting for the shuttle. Nowhere it said if we had to wait, where, or if we had to call.The room was OK and with a nice bed, and with a very good blinds system that I had not seen anywhere else, and that can actually block 95% of the outside light or give enough privacy and still allow natural light.But if even though breakfast food was not bad, the fact that they use cardboard plates (and very rough ones) and plastic cutlery, is disappointing.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,10,"Upon check in, we were told we only were suppose to have 3 rooms instead of 5. We were booked for 5. We told the receptionist IHG reservations made an error. The receptionist did not listen to us, treated us as we were liars and provided us with a bill of over 1000 dollars extra to pay. After she finally decided to cancel the two rooms, she still tried to charge us for the amount of the five rooms. Note: She cancelled the rooms and tried to still charge us. We did the calculations on our phones at the desk for each room and she did her calculations several of times before LISTENING TO US and finally realizing she was charging us 1000 dollars extra. She admitted she did it incorrectly and in politely proceeded on with check in. She went and got her manager and the manager appeared and told us that at her courtesy she will cancel the rooms but we should be charged for the extra rooms that we did not book. She told us that three times as if we were at the mercy of “HER.” After figuring out the correct total of the rooms, we were asked for a 300.00 deposit fee, 25 dollars for each room, 3 rooms for 4 nights. We were not informed of this fee at reservations and we have stayed at several of IHG properties and never paid a deposit fee on the top of the room fee. We were told we would get our money back after we check out and that the fee must be paid. After all of that...After we checked in, We were given a room that was already occupied by another guest. My husband was the first to catch the elevator and go ahead and go to the room while I was finishing up with the receptionist. He made it up and He went into the room and the room was already occupied by another guest. We were given the room and key of occupied guest. My husband has an athletic physique and he is a black male and of course he could have been mistaken as he was trying to break into the room or could have been falsely accused of trying to do something to the guest...what I’m saying is it could have turned out ugly, my husband could have been tragically injured or killed but Thankfully, the guest was not in the room only their luggages and personal items were. My husband called and me and immediately left out of the room and went back to the receptionist and told me and her. The receptionist did not inform her manager of what had just happened, she blew it off, said they were sorry, there was a mix up and did nothing else but provided us with another room and key.","Dear latischam,Thank you for your review of our hotel, We are sorry to hear your recent stay did not meet your full expectations, rest assured the matter is being looked into.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"Receptionists were not that friendly or smiling people! One day when we called the hotel from the LAX Airport to ask to send the Shuttle Bus in the night, the receptionist took the name and room nr. and still said there is no reservation! When I said we have already checked-in a day before, then he checked again and found out!Shuttle Bus to/from LAX Airport to the hotel - though the hotel provide shuttle bus when guests needed from the LAX Airport guests must have a local mobile to call the hotel. In our case we had only Europe mobile nos. (which is expensive to use for a local call) so had to request some local people to help us to make a call from the LAX Airport to the hotel. Apparently, every time we asked someone local they did help.People like us travelling from Europe don't have a car there, so the only option is the hotel shuttle bus, so shuttle bus is a great help!Hotel was under a major renovation, which was effected very negatively on the guests. They have not provided a seating area for the guests in the lobby/somewhere just to sit and relax beside a 2 seater sofa right in front of the lift & the temporary reception (very congested space).The room was extremely spacious, nice & very cleaned. Housekeeping staff (we didn’t meet anyone personally) have been very professional and cleaned the room everyday, changed towels everyday!Breakfast was also reasonably laid out and enough to get going with the day! But the space was not enough for the guests.

Since the windows do not open, I do not want to imagine what bacteria are living in this hotel.After a wonderful experience at thd Holiday Inn in Fullerton, it is clear that this chain exists in name only.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,10,"Flew into LAX the other night and decided to stay at the Holiday Inn Express near the airport due to my being an IHG reward member and getting a ‘deal’ of $156.43, paid in advance.Check in was okay and we stopped in our room briefly to get settled before heading out for the night. The room was clean although strangely set up. The bed was up against a pole (see photo) so whoever slept on the inside had to either climb over the other person or the end of the bed to get to their side. Also, we noticed a paper on the counter that mentioned the water would be shut off in the building from noon to 5:00 pm that day, which we didn’t pay much attention to as it was after 5:00 pm and the water was working just fine.When we arrived back to the hotel around midnight and back to our room, we were surprised to turn on the sink to brush our teeth and find that the water was no longer working. It seemed odd as we passed the front desk on our way in and there was no mention to us of any issues. That said, I called the front desk and asked what was going on, and was told (very defensively) that the water was shut off and they had no information on when it would be back on. That was it. Nothing else. Nothing about how we should proceed with using the toilet or having access to water to even brush our teeth.We proceeded to go downstairs, again, it’s after midnight at this point, to see what is going on and are told the same thing as I was told over the phone. I was told that if I wanted a refund of my advance payment at the hotel, I would need to pack up and find another place to stay, otherwise they could compensate me for my trouble with IHG points in the approximate amount of what their hotel goes for a night, which he said was 10,000 points. As we had a flight to catch in the morning, we took our chances and the points and stayed the night after asking (they didn’t volunteer this!) if they had any water bottles they could give us so we could brush our teeth.Alas, there was no sleep to be had at this hotel. As we had the room next to the stairwell on the 6th floor and one of the elevators was out of service, at least 6 times during the night, the loud slamming of the stairwell door woke us up. It was ridiculous. The hotel should either not rent this room out or look into something to quiet the door closure. The first time it happened, it startled us so bad we thought someone was trying to break into our room.After a disappointing stay, I was even more disappointed to find out that after they gave me 10k points for our troubles, it turns out, looking online that the true amount of points should have been about 35,000. I’m not sure where the front desk representative got the information that their hotel stay was approximately 10k points, but he was way off.The only positives at this location were the safe and courteous shuttle drivers who took us to and from the airport and the morning breakfast, which had a good supply of foods, although it seemed a little odd that they stop serving at 9:30 am on the weekend.","Please accept our apologies for the challenges you experienced during your stay with us.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,20,"I'd just flown in from travelling around Mexico, Guatemala & Belize, where the rooms were clean and well maintained. Okay, the one in Mexico City was a bit run down. But I expected something much better in LA! It was hard to find where to catch the complimentary bus and I'd hate to get on the bad side of the driver - not very friendly! The reception was okay, but the lift blew me away (Admittedly, tired, I'd gotten into the goods lift, but the sign was small) with big holes in the room, material streaming down the sides and dirty as hell. Maybe they need to make the sign bigger as its the first lift you see. However, the Guest Lifts weren't that much better. The corridor floor carpets were so old and sticky, while there was paint peeling. Once I got into the room it was a lot better, although it reeked of cigarette smoke, old stale cigarette smoke that's ingrained into the carpets.

I'd stayed in an LAX Hotel about 12 years previously and I still rave about how good the breakfast was - this was more Mexico average. I went out on a tour and came back to fly out that night. It was then I discovered two gems in the hotel. Firstly, a good souvenir store, from which I could get presents for friends. Secondly, and more importantly, a bar, Landings Lounge, which had local boutique beers, a good barman and a top burger. Most hotels, if they have a bar, only have the commercial rubbish, but these featured local IPAs, etc on tap! I talked to other travelers at the bar and they agreed on the beer quality. Its bars like this that are changing the World's impression of US beers! I've heard that they are renovating, so maybe it might have changed since my visit in January 2018. If so, I might stay there again for the bar, but get breakfast elsewhere.","Thank you for taking the time to submit our online survey.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"We checked in to the HI Express for one night when arriving in to LAX a the start of the month. We had not been notified that the hotel was having a range of refurbishment work being done to it during our stay. There was a make shift bar and restaurant. So services where limited.The room that we had was large and spacious, however dated.The back of the office chair at the desk was missing, the leather sofa tired and cracked. But the room never the less clean. The hotel in general was having a big revamp and I we stayed during this period.I do think that an email should have been sent or a warning placed on the hotel website informing you of this. As realistically, I would have chosen another place to stay especially for the price you paid for the room.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"This place is behind the La Quinta and a McDonald in a side alley. Check-in is understaffed and thus prepare for wait when checking in. When I arrived only one person was doing both check-in and out. Check-in staff is helpful and friendly though.Overall the hotel is in need of TLC.The restaurant curtains I was seated next to were dirty and had dried food spots on them, the restaurant table was bitterly scratched. Wallpaper in bathroom was peeling and all over the walls along the hallways and the elevator were scratch-marks. Whilst my room had been updated, it did not at all look like the photos you see on Tripadvisor. Best thing was the Keurig coffeemaker in the room!My room was on level two towards the back (uneven numbers). You might want to avoid this side of the floor as it is on eyelevel with the vents and air-conditioning units of the ground floor roof. When they kick in you have a permanent humming noise.The breakfast buffet is totally overpriced for the selection and lackluster presentation of the food (almost $20 incl tax). Find a nice place somewhere else for BF would be my advice.I definitely cannot understand how anybody can rate this place as excellent or very good as even compared to other Holiday Inns, I stayed at, this one is tired and worn. Obviously not well managed or managed with minimum expense to staff and upkeep. It is however on the lower priced side of hotels near LAX and you get, what you pay for. It is thus good for one night. Lower your expectations and you may not be disappointed.","Hello cbroo,Thank you for your stay and for taking the time to leave us the above feedback.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,10,"So basically we paid $20 for parking, even though there was absolutely NO parking. When we asked the women at the front desk what we should do, they argued and tried to say that there was and we just “weren’t looking” (keep in mind this after driving around for 25 minutes looking to see if any parking spots had cleared up). So we asked if they could show us where these parking spots were and the security guard took a few steps outside and said for us to just park in handicapped parking since there truly were no parking spots available. Overall, the staff were very unprofessional and very rude. Hospitality is a joke at this place.BUT THATS JUST THE START. When we walked into the bedroom, there was trash that was never cleaned, a broken toilet seat, and hairs in “clean” towels. Of course we weren’t going to complain again because now at this point the entire staff has treated us like we were an inconvenience.Moral of the story; this place is horrendous. They have no sense of customer service and the cleaning is obviously not something they care about. Don’t waste your money here.

There were cereals, milk, yogurt, breads and cooked, fruit juice, water, lemonade, tea and coffee.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,10,"Firstly I must explain that I have not stayed in this hotel. My wife and I had booked for one night at the beginning of our big Californian holiday on August 24th. We had pre booked a slightly cheaper rate on a no refund basis. Let me make that clear. We had booked to stay at a number of hotels along the way. Due to major family illness our trip had to be cancelled. All the hotels we were booked into have been amazing and had no problem (when they understood and saw evidence of our situation) in helping us with refunds. I have called the Holiday Inn at LA airport on a number of ocassions to be told to call back but the right person is never available to talk to.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,Hotel has a great location close to LAX good for late arrivals or early departures . They are currently remodeling which is good.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"Very helpful having the airport shuttle after a long haul flight. Front desk pleasant enough. Room looking very tired, ripped faux leather bed head, chest of drawers drawer that didn't shut, dirty stain on chest of drawers but the room and bathroom were clean.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,20,We stayed here because it was close to airport and had free parking.First night the bed was hard and not very comfortable.When I woke up I had a bill under my door to checkout but I had a reservation for 3 days. Went to front desk and they straightened it out. That morning the in room coffee maker didn't work because some of the outlets are wore out.About 20% of the stations didn't work and had no HBO till the last day.Every morning the garbage truck pulls in the back alley and the backup beepers and the dumping of the trash wakes you up around 4am.The shower was great and a good.Breakfast was good and the staff was very nice.,"Thank you for your review or our hotel.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"We were transiting from Honolulu through Los Angeles en route home to London. We arrived after a bad flight at 6.30 pm. We had been forwarned by TripAdvisor reviews that there was no free telephone to summon the shuttle at the airport. We found a man with a badge saying ,can I help you, he was a local guide and gave us the use of a telephone to summon the shuttle, so our tip is to look for the local help. The shuttle took 15 mins to arrive and then 20 mins to the hotel. The room was large clean and quiet.Breakfast hot and plentiful. We sat by the large pool area during the morning. Check out is at 12, the shuttle went off from the hotel every 30 mins. All in all an average airport hotel but the arrangements for getting the shuttle at the airport are poor.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"The bed was comfortable, the shower pressure and temperature were good, the hotel was clean, and the area feels safe. The main reason for my only average rating was the wifi. I was completely unable to use the internet in even the most basic capacity. I connected to the internet, it showed good signal strength, but I could never get further than the Google search page before getting an error message regarding connectivity. I was unable to check my email, the status of my flight, or even search for food.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,10,"Called to assure pick up at hotel pickup terminal at airport. Was told shuttle ran every 30 minutes. After 40 minutes and watching all other hotel shuttles go by every 15 I called motel and was put on hold for 10 minutes. I was then told by the manager that I had received false information and that the shuttle only responded when requested, contrary to what the hotel policy information I had been listening to on hold for 10 minutes stated. After waiting another 20 minutes I again called to see if they would provide me a taxi, I was assured I could in 5 minutes if the shuttle did not show up. He arrived in 4 after the call, exactly an hour and 20 minutes after my first phone call and about 7 hrs before my next flight. The driver then informed me that they cold not be expected to check all the terminals every half hr because there was to many, and often no one to pick up. Every other motel shuttle was doing this, even the mom and pop hotels so I don't know how I ended up getting the motel with the incompetent staff and lazy shuttle driver but my wife sure made sure I knew about my choice in hotels. Motel was fine, only I hardly stayed there as it took me two hrs to get from the airport to check in.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"Booked the Holiday Inn Express - LAX as a one night stop before flying out at the end of a long trip, based on our membership with IHG Rewards. Things didn't start well when the shuttle from LAX failed to appear. On our first phone call to the hotel, we found out that the shuttle was covered in livery from another organisation (a car park I think) and only had signs to the Holiday Inn Express on the windows. On our second phone call, the bus drove straight past the bus stop, empty, and making no attempt to see if there was anyone waiting. Despite our attempts flag it down we ended up having to get an Uber from the airport. FYI, the shuttle bus to the Holiday Inn (as opposed to the Holiday Inn Express) went past at least 5 times whilst we were waiting - we were also able to identify where other buses where going by recognising their drivers as they had been around the circuit so many times.To their credit, management reimbursed us for the Uber ride, however, as a first engagement with the hotel it was greatly disappointing.Whilst the room was functional (what we expected), we are easily able to leave our bags in storage whilst we did some shopping and some of the staff where friendly, we left the next day with the impression that it all seemed a little too much for them. I'll freely admit that we were really tired after a long day's travel when we arrived and that will have coloured our experience, but when you are a hotel that relies on servicing passengers in and out of one of the busiest airports in the world, isn't the point of what you do is to ensure that stuff like this doesn't happen?IHG Rewards membership not withstanding, we won't be staying here again.","Thank you for your review of our hotel.

Noise level was relatively high from neighbors all around. Airport noise wasn't bad later at night until early morning. The breakfast was typical HI Express, which was fine except for the watery orange juice. Not a bad place to stay if you need to be close to LAX.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,10,"I was very disappointed with the kind of mediocre service i received at this hotel. We needed a place close to LAX Airport in preparation for our next day trip, and so we chose this hotel. Two receptionists greeted us, they were kind, but you could tell they were not happy. When we rode on the tired elevator, we were still hopeful. Our hopes was quickly dashed when we stepped out of the elevator and a nasty smell greeted us. It was a rancid and putrid smell from the carpet. It was horrible. The first thing that came to mind was mold. I was worried sick for my kids' health. When we opened the door to our room, the smell got worse. I called the receptionist and she was kind enough to change the room. We were moved from the second floor to the fourth floor. OMG, the new room still had the same nasty smell. It was horrible. We had to go to a store to buy air freshener.This hotel needs a new management team. How can a hotel with so much potential to make huge profit offer such a crappy service?All the amenities are old - the elevator, shower curtain, beds, window curtain, air conditioner, bathroom floor and all.If you can spare a few extra 50 dollars, I strongly suggest that you find another hotel that will provide worthy service.I will NEVER EVER BOOK HOLIDAY INN, EVER!!!",Thank you for your review of our hotel.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"Hotel was recommended by my god mother who lives nearby (within walking distance) as we didn't rent a car. The location was OK: it was near the airport (about 10-15 minutes driving), in between major theme parks (D-land and Uni Studios), and nearby were fast-food, convenient store and some restaurants.We are a family of 4, so we rented a room with 2 double beds. The price and size of the room were OK (within our budget and expectations). Our room was on the higher floor, and overlooked the swimming pool side. I could occasionally hear aeroplanes at night, but not noisy, just a deep far away rumbling, not enough to wake deep sleepers. In addition, there was a coffee maker in the room, and daily supplies of tea bags and sugar. However, we didn't get the pillows we want (firm) even though there was a sign saying we could request this (see photo). When we phoned room service, the person who answered said that all pillows are the same.Breakfast selection was not much, more of Continental style, with scrambled eggs, poached eggs, omelette, fresh uncut fruits (apples, bananas). Disposable utensils, cups and plates were used, which in my opinion, is not very environmentally friendly. However, it seems that it may be catering to people who have to rush to the airport, and grab a ""to go"" breakfast on the way. It was also good for us, as we can grab a tea/coffee before we set off for theme parks.We checked in very late (after 11pm). I had tried to contact the hotel via ""chat"" to notify this, but there was no response. As my child was in USA and could check in earlier, I faxed in a form for this effect, and the hotel took very good care of this, KUDOS ! Night-time staff Kenn was very friendly.We took the free shuttle from LA Airport. We waited a long time at the very busy sidewalk, and were really confused by the many different ""Holiday Inn"" buses, and were afraid to get on the wrong one. Denny was very helpful with our luggages, loading and unloading.Wifi: this was available FREE, my kids were very happy to have this, which was available throughout the hotel, including breakfast room. I would prefer to have more ""family quality time"", but then kids will be kids.Swimming pool: this is outdoors, and need the hotel keycard to get inside. It was opened until 10pm, but not many people were using it. Only my kids tried it. There is a bigger pool, and a smaller jacuzzi warm pool.

Holiday Inn Express Los Angeles-LAX Airport,30,"Stay here on a stop over in LA whilst going to Tahiti. Accomodation was good and clean, but the air conditioner did give a strange smell. Chose this hotel as free shuttle from the airport and close to the airport and had a good price including breakfast. The breakfast was adeqate, but the room is not very big and not enough tables for guests so had to wait. The hotel is close to bus stops as we went to the Westfield Culver City and to Marina Del Rey. Left our luggage with reception and this was securely looked after. One word of warning is check the shuttle you get on as we showed our reservation to theshuttle driver and he told us it was the correct bus but we then ended up at the Holiday Inn not the Holiday Inn express.

Please rest assured that your comment counts, and we are using all comments found to help guide us to what we should do to make your stay more pleasant.As to concerns listed in your email, you are correct that we are an older property, dating back to the time when the Coast Guard took up posts along what would later be called Malibu. So, we are aware of conditions that are due to age and wear and tear that we are developing a plan to correct. At this time, we are anticipating remodeling and redecorating in the near future, and are checking out all of our options.But, the things that we could address, we have. I actually used your letter as a primary basis for several changes I made take effect several months ago. All rooms now receive the two bars of soap mentioned. All rooms receive three towels, the room with two beds and the rooms with jacuzzis receive four towels. I'm not sure if they were available at the time of your stay, but we do have irons, iron boards, and hair dryers available upon request.Credit cards are not charged until you check out, although there will be a preauthorized hold placed for the expected amount of billing to ensure that the credit card is valid and capable of being charged the expected amount. This however, is only a hold, not a charge, and never goes to a charge until the time of checkout, as you could pay with cash at the time of checkout.As to the customer service, I can only advise you that we have changed the staff completely and management as well.

I raised these issues several times with the front desk and despite the smiles, nothing was done. Insane not to be able to make a phone call. Front desk even sent a technician to my room, who said the issue was with the front desk! Was Basil Fawlty lurking in the office somewhere. Such promise, but in reality an utter disappointment.","BabyJane101, we are so sorry to have let you down. We regret that everything in your room wasn't in perfect working order.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,10,I stayed here for 1 night and that was enough. My room had a view of a carpark and a portaloo. I had to keep the curtains drawn because of workers coming and going in the carpark. The room and bathroom was tiny and the toilet roll flew off every time I used the loo. The TV didn't work nor did the phone charger and the airconditioner was incredibly loud.This was a work trip and my employer organised the payment. The system was down on checkout so I wasn't able to see the charge. They said they would email me the charge but that never arrived. I was shocked to see they put the room charge on my credit card. They said it would take 5-7 working days to fix. It's now 3 weeks and no one has replied to any of my emails or phone calls. I agree it is in a great location but overall it was a terrible experience.,"Kelloggs1209, we sincerely apologize for letting you down.

It could not be further from the truth.When we checked in they gave us a room right near the elevator. The bed was so small it could barley fit two small ladies.The tiny, tiny room was basically a studio that can barely fit one person, let alone two.There was a sliding door separating the bathroom and what passed as a bedroom room with a full bed.The sliding door was broken and would not close. We called and asked for a different room but were told by the front desk agent that we had the lowest class booking and we could not change rooms without an upcharge. Okay, we asked what could be done. We were informed that a repair man could come and fix the door in a few hours.We needed to get ready now and could not wait “a few hours”.We called back about upgrading and moving rooms. The front desk agent told us that if we upgraded the room would not be ready for a bit so we would have to wait.Ugh. No privacy to use the bathroom in a tiny space. No space to get ready.Shoddy furnishings and a staff that does not care.They advertised a complimentary drink, so we went downstairs to check that out. They only offered a glass of “champagne” that was about $3 a bottle and no other drinks were included.Chatting with the bartender, he told us that the hotel is going to be torn down soon. Not surprising.Don’t get duped by cute pictures of this place. Parking was $45. Rooms are run down and tiny. Service was deplorable.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,30,We stayed here for 3 nights and the location is perfect and the staff incredibly helpful. Especially when our toilet blocked twice and one of the ladies organised us a sightseeing trip.

Also the resort fees I wasn't aware of til I got there. The room was ok but needs updating a little and we were scared to use the loo cos it kept blocking.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,20,"The location was nice and the staff was ok. More important I'd echo other reviewers that the resort fee was more than excessive, particularly as my first awareness of it came as I was checking out and therefore only benefitted from the free wifi and not the other ""perks"". This was not mentioned when I made my reservation or checked in. I also think the parking fee amount was opportunistic given the local street parking rules and the resort fee.I've seen management's response to other critical reviews. I'd suggest rather then hoping guests have a better experience ""next time"" (note that most guests having a poor experience are not likely to return), a nicer gesture would be to return phone calls when a guest calls after their stay and asks to speak to management.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,20,"We had one day to spend in LA. And decided we wouyld pick a nice hotel in Beverly Hills. Maison 140 had a good offer on Hotels at two hundred plus. We booked. Upon check in at 11 pm, we were told the hotal would charge an additional mandatory ""resort fee"" of 17 per person. We inquired on what grounds, since the place did not offer any infrastructure, restaureant, pool...They argued we could use the hotel across the street swimming pool, and the charge corresponded to this use. We were leaving 7am. No room for negociation. Then came the parking. Maison 140 is nested between two huge parking lots. Our car was parked in the street. The reception told us street parking overnight was forbidden unless you have a Beverly Hills resident pass. So we would need to use the Hotel Parking. At a thirty seven US rate...Total fare ended up being over three hundred. For a room barely the size of a king sized bed, a bathroom where you needed to squeeze to get in and a window air conditioning machine that made us feel like we were at the end of the airport runnaway...Should the Hotel proposal have been honest we could have picked a much better hotel for the monies spent.","Brazil_8, we are so sorry for disappointing you.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,30,"I stayed at the Maison 140 recently while traveling on business. My options are limited since I have to travel on a government rate, but I probably wouldn't stay at this hotel again.The hotel bills itself as the former residence of the actress Lillian Gish. It has lost all semblance of a private residence, and feels rather more like a flop house... When I can I like to stay in smaller hotels, but this one has little charm. The place is really quite tired. My room was small but fine for one person (a ""Parisian"" room--it would have been very tight for 2)--the bathroom was tiny.As the hotel does not have central A/C, there are individual units mounted through the walls. Mine was a bit noisy and cycled on and off about every 60 seconds. If you're a light sleeper, this might be a problem for you. Having said that, I did not hear noise from the hallways or other rooms, so other guests did not bother me. I don't know how full the hotel was when I was there.My room looked out over a parking lot in the back--not sure what the rooms on the opposite side look out on.The service was quite friendly at check-in and check-out, and when I had some questions about the neighborhood the woman at the desk was cheerfully helpful. The location is not quite in the center of the Beverly Hills scene, but still convenient--maybe a 10-minute walk to Rodeo Drive.Overall, given the location this is a good value for the money, but it's definitely no-frills, and next time I'm in town I'll probably look for one of the larger hotel chains that will take my business rate.","TripsPlease, thank you for taking the time to share your thoughts with us.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,30,"THE PROS:- Location: near the intersection of Santa Monica Blvd and Wilshire.- Parking: I booked a special that included parking, which is typically around $40. This is in a residential area and there is metered parking on the street from 10am-6pm. So after 6pm you can just park right outside. They have a self-park parking lot next to their building which is also convenient for in and out.THE CONS:- Upon arrival, the two front desk receptionists were discussing an issue and failed to acknowledge my presence for a good 2-3 minutes as I sat right in front of them (not even a 'Hello, we'll be right with you'.- The receptionist gave no instruction regarding the parking besides giving me a numbered ticked to put on my dashboard. Do I leave the keys with you? Does someone come take the car? I had to ask.- Rooms are small, which is fine if you aren't spending a lot of time in them.- There was only one set of towels in the bathroom. Who does this? Are they that short on towels? We had to ask.- There was no top sheet on the bed. Personally, I prefer to have a top sheet between me and the duvet.- The rooms could use a deep cleaning.- The photo on this site of the pool is at their sister property around the corner.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,30,"Room was okay, small, not much space to put our luggages or for us to walk around in. Staff were great and most pleasant. Stayed for 2 nights, room service missed putting out soap and bath mat on second night. Urban Bundle charge (or Resort Fee, whatever they call it) was a joke! Got dinged with 2 calls that we didn't make. There was also an Occupancy Surcharge of 1.2% - we wondered what was it for. Although not substantial enough to want us to pursue a credit return, it sure left us with a bad taste in the mouth. Whatever rate you get, just add on 25% and that's excluding parking that is a separate charge of $37.","luv2wheels, thank you for your review! I'm thrilled to share your great feedback with the team, but we do apologize for overlooking the soap and bathmat on your second night. We'll be more mindful about that going forward. We're sorry too about the erroneous phone charges and will be happy to adjust that if you would kindly contact us with the details of your reservation. Please know that we strive to offer our guests more value by including WiFi and other services in the Resort Fee rather than charging incremental fees that add up. We try to be as transparent as possible with all fees and city/state taxes by including details on our website and confirmation letter, but we're sorry for any miscommunication. We offer parking-inclusive packages to simplify things too. We hope you’ll consider staying with us again when you return to LA.

At first glance when you walk in, it looks very trendy...but it has an odor that is off-putting. It doesn't take much to do a resurface of an old bathtub, and although they did it at one point, it's cracking (was cracking two years ago), and leaves a bad taste in your mouth. Also, this is the first hotel that doesn't put a sheet around the blanket?? They put one ontop but your sleeping under a blanket that has no cover. Ick. The overall idea and concept of this place was good 12 years ago, but they should have Kelly Wearstler come down and stay in room 303--and let her sleep without a duvet and stepped into a cracked surfaced bathtub.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,20,"My first time using Hotels To Igor and I got a pretty good deal on what is usually a higher priced hotel. Great neighborhood, close to my early morning appointments. When I got there at 9:30 pm, I waited for at least 30, maybe 45 minutes for the girl at the desk to help me while she checked in a number of other late arriving guests. She complained the entire time...loudly. Once I got to the desk, she told me they were overbooked! She called someone from their sister hotel, her boss I guess who came over and reprimanded her in front of me telling her she didn't know what she was doing and there were two rooms left. She ran up to check and make sure those two rooms were clean (at 10 pm???) and I finally went up. Comfortable bed, but Its summer in LA and the very small space had a wall mounted room air conditioner blowing so loudly I had to cover my head all night. It was freezing while it blew, but hot if I turned it off and no way to adjust the fan that I could see. On the desk there were two water bottles that said ""free with urban package"" and no indication whatsoever what an urban package was-I assumed I had it. At check out I learned there would be a $16.00 charge for the 16 oz generic brand non gold plated water bottle. The bathroom, although lavishly appointed with beautiful marbles, is so small it was impossible to sit on the toilet without knocking over the toilet paper and forget about shaving your legs in the shower! The final joke was that this was the big room according to the girl at the front desk!","Hello Elizabeth M,I'm sorry you had a poor experience while staying at Maison 140.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,30,"all in all, i think it is a super cute hotel. we always stay at the century city hyatt when my husband comes for work, but since they are renovating we decided to try this nearby boutique hotel. our stay was not horrible, they just have a few things to work out.a lot of people mention a smell. my husband was totally turned off by the smell when you walk in the lobby. you would think since so many people complain about it that they'd figure something out! nope, smells weird. luckily our room did not smell as bad.our biggest hiccup - we tried to check in early. the girl at the front desk was a little off. she took our phone number and said she'd call in about an hour when the room was expected to be ready. i never received a call, but decided to check back in about 2 1/2 hours later (around 2:30pm). she told me our room wasn't ready but she'd put me in another room. she didn't tell me that room would be right next to the elevator. thanks :)i started working from the room and kept hearing noises, thinking it was people going in and our of their rooms. no, it was the elevator. i called down around 4pm and asked for a different room but was told the hotel was sold out. i explained that we were supposed to have a different room, so they must not have been sold out earlier in the day, but the person was not particularly interested in being accommodating. much like the front desk girl.moral of the story - request to be in a quiet room, away from the elevator. if you accomplish that, you will enjoy the hotel. the location is very convenient to shopping, restaurants, etc. i walked to the whole foods less than a mile away to grab some snacks for the room (after i opened the oreos in the mini bar and they were super stale).if you don't have a budget, go stay at one of the fancy hotels in the neighborhood. if not, this is definitely a suitable stay.","Dear Sarah S,Thank you for trying us, while The Century Plaza is under renovation. They too our one of our favorites. Yes, we definitely have investigated any odors or anything else for that matter that guest report to us. We've deep cleaned, re-pipped, re-carpeted, have and are in the middle of re-doing our sheers and drapes, our air conditioning units, etc. etc. Like all hotels in the area, we use eco-friendly cleaning products, and as an extra step, we use homemade eco-friendly products to improve odor control. We are a much older hotel, having been built in the early 1900s, thus odors are different than a hotel built of concrete in the 1960s, and to your point. We understand everyone has their preferences.

The bed and pillows were very comfortable, though the bed was quite low (would cause problems for some people).Parking is $30, which is completely excessive in my opinion, especially after paying almost $200 for the room.I didn't try the restaurant or bar, but the bar seemed to be popular.Breakfast is not included (another negative quality, in my book).The elevator was fun because it was so old fashioned.This hotel is a fine choice, but there are better options in the area.","Dear uclatraveler9,Thank you for writing your review.

The rooms are very dark and the wall air conditioners are EXTREMELY loud.I have stopped staying here due to the service. While the front desk is always helpful, the bar is inconsistently available where they say to have food service. The food comes from their property up the street, which isn't bad, but inconsistently available. They sometimes close earlier than stated which is a problem in BH if you want a restaurant within walking distance after 9PM. There really isn't anything. They recently began charging for parking, which is a bummer, since they have a lot beside the building which is usually empty.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,30,"The Maison 140 boutique hotel is a very unique small hotel decorated by Kelly Wearstler. Picture late 60's boudoir mixed with 1920's french noir influence. There really ins't a lobby per-se. Just a small check in area and a cute, dark little bar to left.The hotel is literally right next door to the fabulous Peninsula and is located in the heart of Beverly Hills. Perhaps a 10 minute walk to Rodeo Drive. Starbucks, Teavana, and some other smaller cafes are a stone's throw from the hotel on Little Santa Monica Blvd.Please note, the hotel is a former apartment building. One of my main criticisms of the hotel is the musky, old smell throughout the building and in the room. A somewhat powerful smell and unfortunately not what you expect when staying at a luxury boutique hotel in Beverly Hills.The room itself was good. The decor was great (very Viceroy-ish). The bed was very comfortable and the A/C (while loud) was refreshingly cool! The bathroom had great style, although it is quite small. The shower pressure was good and the toiletries (Neil George) were great! I took a look at the Room Service menu and the prices were identical to the prices at the Peninsula. That didn't make sense since Maison 140 is nowhere as luxurious as the Peninsula.There was some wear and tear in the room that could have been easily repaired by management.Service was fine. Standard. Nothing expectional. Parking is $30. Standard for the area.Would I stay there again? Yes, only if the price was right and if the Peninsula was sold out.","Hello TravelLawyerOC,Thank you for your detailed review.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,20,"My husband and I stayed in the above stayed in the hotel from October 16th thru the 18th of 2015.This was our first stay at this hotel. We are a huge fan of the boutique style hotels. We feel the service, style, ambiance and over all attention to detail is far superior to that of 200 plus room hotels; for near or at the same price, but this time it was not the case.Upon check-in the young man never advised us of the $30 a day charge for parking our car. Outrageous. As a guest number one, advisement would be great, also as a guest paying $200 for a room charging $30 for parking, not even in our recent trip to Vegas did that happen.Room service was sub-par. $30 for two quesadillas that we were told would take 10 minutes, it took 25 min.On the 17th we left the tag on the door for housekeeping to service our room. We also told the young lady at the desk we needed this done in our room, and we would be out for a few hours. She asked if we had the tag on the door, we advised her we did. When we returned it was not done. We called the front desk explained this and said since it was not done can we get at least fresh towels, they replied with a yes. After an hour no towels, mind you it was about 330. So my husband heard someone in the hall and it was housekeeping but with no towels, he asked her for some and she obliged, but with a attitude as if we were a bother to her.With the room I would advise a blind in the bathroom window, the light goes right into the face of the other sleeping in the bed. Some couples might even like privacy.Over $600 spent at this hotel, and it by far was not worth it. Lack of service, communication, up charge of products and the ""oh that's to bad I don't care attitude of the employees"" really makes the Maison 140 an overpriced motel at best. The Gish sisters home deserve better and so do the guests that are going to stay there.On another note, this was the email I sent to the manager on the 18th, I have yet to hear from anyone.","Dear alliemia2,Thank you for your review.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,30,"We stayed here on a trip to LA for a family birthday becuase our regular choice, its sister hotel the Mosaic wasn't available. This place is definitely an acquired taste. It was the personal home of the actress Lillian Gish and her sister so it looks inside and out like a house. First the good stuff. The staff is great, from the very helpful front desk to the skillful bartenders to housekeeping and even the valets in the parking lot. The location is incredible--on a quiet Beverly Hills side street one block south of Wilshire, one block east of Santa Monica, and right behind the Peninsula. You have access to the Mosaic if you need the pool or the fitness center but they can provide you a discount coupon for Equinox fitness clubs two blocks away. Now the not so good stuff. The decor is just weird. Black and white is a good decorating scheme unless the walls are black and the trim is white. It gives the place a strangely funereal air. Since it was a home, the rooms vary in size. One of us had 204 which was bright and sunny and very pleasant. Another in our group had 203, which looked over the parking lot and literally had NO closet. There was a tiny closet originally in the room but after they crammed a console with the minbar fridge into it along with the ironing board, there was room for maybe a couple of shirts and a pair of pants. We ended up living out of our suitcases. That having been said the rooms were well-appointed and comfortable. The elevator is sort of odd too. It is finished in a Chinese red with lots of mirrors and moves so glacially slowly I was surprised I didn't find a skeleton with a rolling suitcase in there when the door opened! If you're looking for a place to lay your head in a great location, this might fit your bill if you're willing to put up with a bit of quirkiness.","Michael V,Thank you for your email and the detailed description of your experience and our hotel.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,10,"Ten years ago I stayed at this hotel which was practical, central and quiet. It had a certain charm and while mostly painted black to hide flaws of the original structure and designed on a dime, it worked. But now it simply has fallen to a level of unacceptable pathology. First, a sour stench in the air upon entering. Evey time, all the time. Incompetent front desk staff who are rude with attitude. Hallways smell musty and sour due to heavy cleaning product on the acrylic black carpeting. Rooms smell the same. Upon arrival I notified front desk that the old fashioned plug-in air conditioner is stuck at 70 degrees; does not turn off and blowing loudly. This was never addressed. My laundry took four days to be returned after several calls to attitude. My robe was removed from the room and while front desk promised 'we send it right away' it never arrived. Valet park attendant was never to be found and breakfast non-existent two days with an excuse 'our person has not showed up'. All in all this place has gone down the tubes and needs a serious management overhaul. Upon my arrival home I unpacked and found ALL of my clothes smelling strongly of the sour stench.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,30,"Our third visit to Maison 140 left us wondering why we returned. While the hotel is uniquely boutique, it was disheartening to be given a room that shared a wall with the elevator shaft. This resulted in a vibrating bed each time the elevator was operating. The door that accesses the bathroom is about 6 feet wide and needed two hands to pull it across its track. Half of the door is frosted glass which means morning light pours through from the bathroom window. The worse part was the lumpy unsupported mattress leaving one of us with a backache that persisted for a couple of days. To the credit of the hotel, we were able to change room for the second night. Location is great, although it would be nice not to have to walk to Starbucks for morning coffee. The hotel and rooms are clean and generally quiet with few amenities other than free Wi-Fi. AC blows directly on the bed. Staff is pleasant but unapologetic about problems. The rates are about one-fourth that of the Peninsula across the street which by the way has a great breakfast menu.","Hello Afocus1,Thank you for taking the time to write your review.

Maison 140 Beverly Hills,20,"I am not sure how this hotel has 4 stars, though it is at the bottom of the list for Beverly Hills (where it should be). I spent a week here, and I was so happy to leave. Upon walking in, the hotel lobby smells like stale spilled coffee, likely from the breakfasts served down there and a lack of proper cleaning. The issues with smell carry into the dark, dank hallways and rooms, which feel and smell (and are) dirty. My room was, like the others, a dated pink color with ugly furnishings. The bathroom was extremely small, so much so that it was uncomfortable. The A/C-fan was old and dirty. It clearly had not been cleaned in a long time. It was very loud when on, and the air coming in was not so fresh. The room generally smelled of mildew and dirty carpet. It is clear that they never deep clean their carpets. On the last day, I was given dirty towels (with a black substance on them), and had to dry off with a face towel after my shower. I will also say that the design for the hallways is a bad one. It is dark and moody, but it is cheap and fails miserable. Instead, it is just kind of creepy and odd. I would avoid this hotel. The only reason for a second star is that it happens to be in a very good location and has parking (paid).","Dear LMZV,Thank you for taking the time to write us a review.

I ended up sleeping on the floor to somewhat combat itThere was NO AIR CONDITIONING and it was so warm inside the room that sleeping was almost impossibleThe first thing I did when I got into the room was look to turn the overhead fan on and noticed COBWEBS all over the light fitting, it was evident that these had been there for a long time. I removed these with some tissue and hoped that this would be the end of it... Nope... I was stood in the room and casually put my arm on the window ledge and it was just full of dirt. This place was as if it hadn't been cleaned properly in monthsThe location is pretty poor too unless you plan on driving everywhere and paying the parking feesStay here only if you don't plan on sleeping and only need a place to store your bags ... It hurts to know I gave this place my hard earned money","You can always check our room first and then decide if it is ok with you to stay. Our rooms are extremely clean and this is a must for us. We do not have A/C, we are very close to ocean and we get ocean breeze every morning and evening. This dear guest chose a very small room with full size bed not a queen because it was cheaper but we do have larger room. Every room has a ceiling fan and if it is needed you can ask for an extra electric fan. If you require A/C then the hotels on Ocean Ave. are the better choice with starting rate of $350.00 per night at this time of the year.

Ocean Park Inn,30,We arrived at the hotel drivin in all the way from Las Vegas and bonus as they had a Free car park that always had room when you went out for the day.The downside we had room 28 which was small and the bed was tiny. The mattress was so squeaky and extremely uncomfortable we think it had its day a few years back!!! But apart from that reasonable value for money and if you have a car the location is good,Yes you are right room 28 is a small room but every thing in that room is brand new from furniture to entire bathroom and an elegant wood floor.

Ocean Park Inn,30,The motel is cute clean and cozy. We had a nice room and the noise from the road and neighbors was minimal. One problem though... the parking is a nightmare. We couldn't get in a stall. We went to dinner came back and the parking lot was full. One stall left and almost impossible to get in. The stall is literally 3 inches on each side bigger them my car. Has about 20 stalls and should only have about 16.,Yes we agree with you. This parking was built in 1956 when we did not have SUV. But we will accommodate every one with one spot.

Ocean Park Inn,30,"I picked this place for the price as hotels and motels are pricey in Santa Monica. Check in was great, we were let in at 1:30 pm when we arrived.Got up to room 37, it's a little tight getting up the narrow stairs and your door is crammed with 4 other rooms all entering and exiting the same way.The room is pretty spacious for a motel. A safe and small closet area are provided. The bathroom has a miniature sink and a small toilet area and a hallway sort of shower.The internet provided would work on my iPhone, but not on my Macbook Pro for some reason. I could not get it to connect to either internet routers and it would just say no connection available really odd.The major problem was at night. The walls are paper thin. The people next door to us in room 36 were literally bouncing off of the walls. Running around, banging into walls and jumping around. Every few seconds there would be a loud thump against the walls and yelling. This went on from 11 pm to 2 am. It was very hard to sleep. I even had a dream that gymnastic students were next door. The cars passing by on the street can be heard too, it's an extremely busy street. Even with earplugs I could hear it.The next morning these crazy people were up at 8 am making noise again. We had a very poor nights sleep and were so relieved we'd switched from 2 nights to only 1 before we arrived. I don't think I could handle another.When I went to check out at 11:05 am at checkout time there was no one in the office. I rang the bell and waited and waited. No one was there. I left my card there. I never got a receipt so I was a little ticked off.I mean it's clean and it's not too far from the beach. But it's a little hard to enjoy a motel stay if you can't sleep. I always bring ear plugs but that didn't drown out the thumping and the cars. I don't even know if there was anyone at the front desk nor did I feel like anything would be done to quiet rowdy guests at a motel.It's not the worst place, but it wouldn't be my pick next time I go to Santa Monica. I'll spring for the extra to get a hotel without paper thin walls.",We are very sorry that you had a bad experience that night. As far as the traffic noise we are installing a triple glass windows in three weeks and hoping to solve that problem. We always have someone on front desk at all time.

Ocean Park Inn,10,"I stayed at the Ocean Park Inn this weekend and there were definitely bed bugs thriving in our room. We left as soon as we discovered this, informed the manager at the front desk, he claimed he had never heard this complaint. Clearly not true after reading more of the reviews this morning. I physically saw multiple living bed bugs as well as spots on the sheets indicating that they have been there for some time. Beware. It's bad enough to have them at the establishment, but to know that this is an existing problem and to not handle it, to lie about it, and choose not to offer any compensation is a shame. You are exposing your employees and your guests to the risk of infesting their own homes. I will be informing my friend who lives in the area to not recommend this inn to anyone else.","I, as a general manger of Ocean Park inn apologized to this guest. We have different clerks at different time. We have 28 units and we are full almost every night. If we have infestation then we should get at least 20 complaints a day and more important we could not be in business by now. The bed bug is a big problem in U.S for last eight years and being carried by the tourists who are coming from overseas. We take it very serious if we find even one. We have a contract with a pest control company for prevention and control and elimination and it works. After this wonderful guest informed us we did inspect the room and fortunately there were not any nests found but never the less we immediately replaced the bed and carpet and fumigate the room and put the room out of commission for three nights.This problem mostly occurs in summer when we have hot weather and many many tourists and as you can see we had no complaints during the summer.

Ocean Park Inn,10,"We booked our room at Ocean Park Inn on booking.com because of the nice photos, the location and the fair price for the area (still USD100$).Once you get there, the courtyard looks charming but the motel is right on the boulevard, with cars passing literally 15m (50ft) from your room at high speed.The staff is neither friendly nor unfriendly, anyway you won't share more than 3 words with them.The room we had was number 28, on the first floor right up the office.As soon as we came into the room we understood the mistake we did while booking this hotel online... It was like a sauna inside despite the nice outside temperature of May, the windows were useless to stop the noise from the boulevard, there was a gap between the door and its frame which didn't help to reduce the dreadful noice.The bathroom was OK.Finally, while going to bed, it appeared that the sheets were not clean at all!!! Some dead insects inside the bed, some melted wax on the mattress cover and some ashes with obvious cigarette burns on the bedside table.Fortunately for us, we just arrived in LAX from a 14 hours day flight so as we were so tired we could managed a very poor sleep with earplugs...In the morning you can have free coffee. I hope this is extra-caffeined coffee which could help you to have a normal day after your sleepless night...I confirm worse hotel EVER.",This was a last minute booking and we did not have any room in the back.

After a couple of nights they managed to relocate us from from an outside to an inside room which was better but smaller. Continuing further problems included - 1. sheet didn't fit the bed so every night it was untucked 2. soap didn't foam so we bought our own 3. sink was blocked (but the plumber was pleasant) 4. Sliding door was stuck on the wardrobe and sliding window also didn't work properly.Good points of this place - 1. day time staff are very nice 2. maids are also nice 3. free coffee is good 4. free and fast internet 5. location is OK but not as good as we expected as it was too far to walk to the beach (this was my own fault for not enough research). 5. Nice fridge.We chose this place as we though it was a good location. However since we were unable to walk to the beach we might as well have stayed somewhere a lot cheaper since we had a rental car.

Ocean Park Inn,30,"I've stayed in several very nice hotels in Santa Monica, but they're all expensive and usually you have to pay an extra $20 or so for parking. This time, I just needed to be close to my doctor's office for an appointment, so I looked for a more affordable option. I read the awful reviews for this hotel, but because of the price and location, I went ahead and reserved a room anyway, expecting the worst. The office staff was friendly, and the check-in process went smoothly. My room was clean, freshly painted and surprisingly spacious. The bed was comfortable (definitely no bed bugs), and there was a new TV, a quiet refrigerator and a ceiling fan. There was free coffee in the lobby in the morning, a Whole Foods market a few blocks away, and a nice neighborhood to go for a walk in right behind the hotel. Best of all, the hotel provides ample free parking - a rarity in this town. So those are the positives. Now for the negatives: (1) The room key was a major pain. Sometimes it took 10 attempts before I could get my door open. Other guests told me they had the same problem. (2) I was told in advance that there was free wireless internet. There is, but not inside your room. The office staff told me to try opening my door, but I still could not get a connection. I had to go outside, into the patio area, and brave cigarette smoke and traffic noise from busy Lincoln Avenue, in order to use my laptop. This was disappointing to say the least. (3) The phone in my room did not work at all. The office staff offered to move me into a different room, which I appreciated, but ultimately I decided to stay where I was. (4) At 4 in the morning, a couple staying in a room across from mine had a huge argument, which woke me up. I could hear pretty much everything they said and was unable to go back to sleep until they settled down. However, until that happened, I had been sleeping really well, so perhaps I was just unlucky. On balance, I was satisfied with my stay, given that it was just for one night and solely for a nearby appointment the next day.","We appreciate your review .

Ocean Park Inn,10,"My friend and I are covered in HORRIFIC bites from BEDBUGS.A friend and I booked a couple of nights in this motel last weekend. Initially the place seemed OK, as described in a few other reviews.However, after the first night, my friend woke up saying he thought he had a few bites, and that we should check for bedbugs. I didnt have any bites, and thought he may have got the bites from a mosquito or something, so we swapped beds for the second night. When I woke up, not only was I covered in numerous incredibly itchy bites, but my friend had actually caught one of the bugs.We took it down to the manager to show him, and I couldnt believe it when he said ""well that's not our problem"", then ""oh it could have been brought in by a previous guest"". When we asked for a refund for some of the stay he said ""Oh that's out of my control, I can't do anything"", which turned into ""Well maybe I can give you a credit for the next time you come to stay here"" (I still can't believe that he thought we would even consider staying there again!!).He really couldnt have been less helpful if he tried, and didnt seem to care that one of his rooms had an infestation of bedbugs.Steer clear of this place at all costs, unless you want to end up covered in huge red itchy welts, with the possibility of transferring bedbugs back to your own home when you get back from your trip.",There is no record of this incident and we can assure the public that we do not have this problem per this guest's allegation. No hotel can survive with ignoring this problem and we check in approximately 70 guests per day and if we did have this problem we would have been out of business by now.

Ocean Park Inn,10,"WARNING: BAD SERVICE: My family (2adults 5 children) were having a road trip from out of state to Santa Monica. I reserved 5 days prior to our trip - 2 rooms, first floor, side-by-side by calling the hotel and providing them with my credit card info to hold the reservation. I told the lady that we would be driving from out of state and couldn't give her a exact TOA but she said it was fine that they will have the rooms ready. When I arrived at 10pm after driving 8hrs with 5 kids- they didn't have our rooms, lost our credit card info. and all they could offer me was an ""I'm sorry"". All they had was one room left but it only had one bed and they wanted to charge me twice the amount for one room then what they told me on the phone!!!! DO NOT STAY HERE!!!!",We are very sorry for your inconvenience. We are partially to be blamed. We cannot guarantee 2 rooms side by side or on the same floor. We will do our best to arrange but in high season with a lot of tourists paying and booking multiple nights it is really difficult for the clerks to guarantee. We always say in advanced that we will try our best but we can't guarantee. On that night we had one on the 1st floor and one on second floor which did not work for you. We apologize for that.

Ocean Park Inn,10,"This is seriously the worst motel experience I have ever had!! My boyfriend & I got to the hotel around midnight, it was late, we were tired & just wanted a cheap place to stay. We went to lobby to check in & there was no one in sight, we rang the bell twice for service & no answer. We waited about 5 minutes & then we just sat down in our car about to leave to go somewhere else, we get a knock on our car window (creepy) ""oh you need room?"" So we said ok & checked in. We got into our room, we were on the bottom floor, room 34. Immeadiately we hear the people above us partying & this went on all throughout the night. Everything echoes! We finally start to fall asleep & around 2 a.m. I am awakened by my boyfriend who looks like he has just seen death. I ask him ""what's wrong?"" He tells me ""oh, you don't even want to know!"" He proceeds to tell me that their is a cockroach in our bed! At this point, I""m screaming, freaked out & don't want to stay there! It had crawled on me while I was sleeping, crawled onto his bare chest & he flung it off, it attached itself to the side of the bed & he tried to kill it with his shoe, but it wouldn't die so he picked it up with a tissue & flushed it down the toilet! Mind you right above the toilet paper, it looks like there were a bunch of pubic hairs! Ewww!! We immediately went up to the front desk, told the manager what happened, requesting a refund & he basically told us that he could not authorize us a refund & that we would need to talk to the owner, who would be in @ 8 a.m. We insisted that the owner come down here immeadiately & resolve this issue, but he said that there is nothing I can do for you! I wanted to leave, but we decide to stick it out till the morning, I did not sleep @ all, I was so paranoid that there would be more cockroaches! We check out the next morning & speak with the owner & he had the nerve to ask us if we saved it? Why would we save it? We don't want it in our room & plus we tried to kill it & it wouldn't die, I don't want a live cockroach in my room all night!! You are out of your mind!! He insisted that they keep the motel very clean (which it was clearly not!) & that they have bug people come out & spray which is some b.s!! He would not refund us our money, he said the best he can do is give us 20% off the next time we stay there, which obviously we will never go back there!! Ewww!! Pay the extra few bucks & stay @ the travel lodge on Pico!",In hotel business we always have guests who are not happy one way or another. We do have a policy of refund with in ten minutes of stay for any reason . We do not even ask. But if there is any deficiency from our part like this guest claim we will refund fully with a sincere apology. But this guests simply claimed that there was one roach which was killed by them and then they stayed the whole night.

Ocean Park Inn,10,"Within 30 minutes of our check-in, we discovered that the sheets had crumbs on them. Although we inspected the room prior to check-in, we did not check the sheets. I assumed that the sheets would be clean. We were not comfortable staying in a hotel with physical debris on the sheets, as this indicates that there are also less visible signs of contamination/debris/dirt. When we approached the clerk working at the hotel (name: Dexter), he would not resolve the matter by refunding our money. He dealt with our request to not stay there with sarcasm and contempt. While he offered us an alternate room, we were not comfortable staying at a hotel with physicial debris in the sheets. Dexter threatened to tell his Manager, Nick, that we were actually in the room for 45 minutes, while it was clearly less than 30 minutes (the time including the dispute was approx. 45 minutes). When I spoke with the manager two days later, he disputed that there was anything wrong with the room and challenged me to try to get my money back. At this time, he indicated he is the owner. I have never experienced unclean sheets in a hotel/motel room. I am offended by the treatment that I and my husband received by the staff and owner. We just want our money back.I have not yet received a refund of the amount we were charged ($85.00) for a room we did not stay in. In addition, I was told by the owner that others have tried to get their money back, unsuccessfully. Interestingly, the internet address and e-mail address they provided to us via their business card are inactive and they do not have voicemail on their telephone recording. I think this is an owner/manager who has no regard for consumers and has immoral business practices that trickle down to his staff members. He should be investigated as I assume there are many others who have had a similar experience and did not receive a refund.",We do have a policy of showing rooms before checking in and also refund with in 10 minutes and no question will be asked and the payment will be fully refunded.

Ocean Park Inn,20,"I stayed 1 night, didn't want to drive home 40 mins after a few drinks. The manager is friendly and when I asked him when checkout time is he actually asked me what time I want, I told him 1PM and he said fine. The place itself is pretty much a hole. It was fairly clean, I didn't do any kind of thorough inspection, but the place is shabby at best. The toilet seat probably cost them 5 bucks, and it was about to break off. There were people talking out front alot, so noise was a bit of a factor. But, I needed a place to crash, and it served that purpose. My biggest complaint is that it cost me 90 bucks. It's still cheap for the area, but overpriced for what you get. If you're looking for 5 stars, this aint the place to stay.

Ocean Park Inn,10,"This hotel is for those who are desperate. If you need a cheap place to stay while you are waiting/looking for a more permanent home...this place will do. They offer a weekly rate of $250+tax, which you can't beat around west la. However, you get less than what you pay for still. I strongly advise you not to stay here for a vacation.On our first day of arrival, we were told that it is a ""self-service"" kind of place. There is no maid service for the bedrooms. The communal bathrooms are the cleanest places in the hotel (cleaned daily). The bedrooms are not for those with weak stomachs. I advise bringing your own cleaners and definitely a can of lysol. I'm pretty sure there was some vomit on our wall from the people before us. The carpet was not clean, I threw a blanket on the floor. There is a cable tv, a fridge, and you have DSL access in the rooms. There is a communal laundry room with two computers w/free internet access, some overpriced vending machines, and an omnipresent older guy looking at porn. The staff is not friendly and seem to be drug-dealers, it's best to keep out of their way. Overall, the hotel has potential to be nice, but it is not well-maintained (their solution to problems is paint and duct tape).The hotel is affiliated with westside rentals and has a great location. Parking is limited, only one spot/room (since half the lot is full of old westside rentals junkers). The hotel is ~30 blocks from the beach and there are bus stops right out front. A Trader Joe's is two blocks away.","This is not the hotel you stayed.

This isn't a quiet location because it is right on a highway and you hear vehicles all night. One evening when we came in someone was hanging around in front of the motel, a little creepy.

The furniture was old and funky and there were no bed lamps, only an overhead light. The bed was uncomfortable. It's located on a very busy 4 lane street, so there is a lot of street noise. The only window in the room was very small and opened to the street, so keeping it open was not an option noise-wise. No amenities whatsoever, not even an ice machine. When I asked for ice, they actually gave me a tray of stale ice from the office refrigerator! You have to park your car next door in a lot out of sight of the motel. It didn't seem very secure to me.

Ocean Park Inn,10,"The reviews on this place were extremely misleading. This is no way a French style inn. It's a poorly maintained, dirty, seedy motel. It's not close to the beach. It would take at least 15-20 minutes to walk to the beach and another 10 to get to the boardwalk. The restaurants close by are only fast food types. I was extremely disappointed. I made my reservation over the phone and the clerk was very friendly and I had high hopes for a nice clean no frills motel. I checked in and was given a very small (basically just room for a bed) oddly shaped room in the back corner with one louvered window overlooking an alley. The carpet was sticky dirty and looked as if it hadn't been cleaned since the place opened. The furniture was all chipped and warped and the closet had no door. The sink made a wailing sound when it was turned on. When the couple staying above us walked around it sounded like elephants clomping. I went back to the front desk to ask for another room. The guy said ""that's our biggest room, very nice!"" I said ""are you kidding me?"". He finally agreed to move me to another room, the only other room available he told me. It was marginally better, but smelled as if it had just been vacated by a 5 pack a day smoker. I said, ""this is a smoking room"". He said ""no, no, it's a non-smoking room"" and pointed to the no-smoking decal on the door, as if that meant anything. Clearly, someone had been smoking in the room a lot. At that point I should have just asked for my money back and gone somewhere else, but my sweetie and I were tired so I accepted the new room. He came in and said ""geez has someone been smoking a cigar in here?"" It was pretty awful. The carpet in this room was also stained and sticky feeling. The toilet tipped back and forth when you sat on it and the shower didn't work at all providing only a mist when turned on. We immediately went out for drinks hoping that we could just come back and catch a few hours of sleep before catching our train in the morning. To top it all off the next morning, my boyfriend made the mistake of looking under the bed. Not only had no one ever vacuumed under there, but there was a homemade club and a mysterious plastic bag with something in it under there. Who knows what that was!

Grafton on Sunset,30,"Check-in was fairly swift. The hotel staff were super friendly at every shift.The hotel hallways were carpeted, which makes rolling bags difficult; hotels should realize that hard surfaces are easier for rolling luggage and better for cleaning.Our room was was a decent size but was dimly lit. Though the lobby looked modern and new, the rooms were old (just take a whiff of the closet) with the old bones still intact. The room had a mini bar but no coffeemaker. The bed was comfortable enough. There were several power outlets on one side of the bed but the other side's outlets didn't work, nor did the one on the desk. They really should keep things in working order for their paying guests.The bathroom was tiny, making it a bit difficult to move around the door, toilet, and shower door. The ceiling fan was ridiculously noisy--more noise pollution than practical. The shower (only) was large and had a little mold, but nothing that housekeeping couldn't remove with some good scrubbing. The shower water pressure was poor. The hanging shelf in the shower was useless, as it tilted down so any bottles placed there would simply fall out. The bathroom counter space was limited but doable.

Grafton on Sunset,20,"I stayed here for a business trip, and I would never have stayed here if I could have chosen my hotel. The saving graces of this place are the saltwater pool and the customer service at the front desk. The pool and the pool deck are very clean and you can get poolside service, which was great. Everything else was strange and pretty rough.First things first, everyone has their own tastes so I'm not going to bash the decor. It's just pretty cheesy and tacky in my opinion. The room I stayed in was quite small, and if I was staying with another person there would have been no room at all to move around. I barely had counter space in the bathroom for my few hair supplies and lotion/toothpaste/toothbrush. The room had poor lighting, and if I wanted it brighter I needed to open the curtains so the whole sunset strip could see me change. Yikes.First thing I did upon getting to my room was use the bathroom. I opened the lid to the toilet, and there was already toilet paper in there and some hair on the floor. The towels were set on a shelf under the sink next to exposed pipe. I went to look at the bed and I had no blanket, just white sheets. Talking to others in the hotel, the blankets available were fake fur, which made me shiver at the thought of how much harder those are to clean rather than regular linen blankets. I decided to forgo that option and went immediately to Target to buy a cheap blanket, towel, pillowcase, and flip flops for the shower. That's $60 I shouldn't have had to spend for the room rates they charge here.Others in my group staying there had a couch in their rooms or at least a chair with back support, but all I had in my room was a strange velvet stool at the desk, and a pink velvet chair that you could not sit up straight in. I stayed on the fourth floor, so I was next to the ""business center"", which was two desktop computers you could use for one hour at a time before it locked you out. Even the chairs there were incredibly impractical. They were what looked like dining room boutique chairs, but they were so low in comparison to the height of the desks that I had to sit on my knees like a child to properly reach the keyboard. I just don't understand why at least the 'professional' section of this place can't just have a simple office chair.Overall, for these rates, absolutely go somewhere else, especially if you like something a bit cleaner and modern. Weekdays are quiet at night, but during Friday nights and weekends it's crazy loud in the lobby and it radiates through the whole hotel. Lucky for me that I brought earplugs to get some decent sleep before my flight the next morning. The best word I can think of to describe staying here is ""yikes"".",Thank you for your review of the Grafton.

Grafton on Sunset,20,"Room was fine, small, but okay. Front desk and staff were helpful. But their kitchen wasn’t open the whole time we were there, at least that’s what they told us, they told us where else to eat, so that right there was super inconvenient.When we received our confirmation email, it did say we had an approximate total. I was expecting to pay more of course, but no where in the email did it mention an amenity fee or a tax on the amenity fee. It was also suppose to include water and a drink each day of our stay, we did not receive that since no one was ever working in the bar when we went in there. Most unbelievable was they TAX THE AMENITY FEE! WTF?! I have never seen that. So an extra 4 dollars for that. I know it doesn’t seem a lot, but that was just ridiculous. Sorry Grafton - I’m not coming back, there are better hotels on Sunset, hotels need to be transparent on fees and taxes.

Grafton on Sunset,30,"There are a few pros and a few contras.I love the pool, even there are no showers around. Rooms are nice, bar is nice as well.Contra: Parking for 45 USD Is too much, next door I could have parked for 15 USD.Also water in the room for 6 USD is too much. Its noisy when people check out their rooms, also my view was bad (looking on a parking garage).Nevertheless good location!","Thank you, we appreciate the score and review as we wish everyone to have a nice relaxing time.

Grafton on Sunset,30,"Nice bathroom with a big shower and good water pressure. Pretty pool area, though I didn't get to enjoy it because it was raining while I was there. Room decor was cheap looking, red and black and white with a mirrored wall and weird silver sofa. The worst part of the hotel was the bed. I slept horribly on a super hard bed with no blanket. On the second night, I found a blanket in the closet and used that, and turned the heat way up so I wasn't cold. I wasn't expecting a luxury hotel at that price, but I was expecting a comfortable bed and a good night's sleep. Also, charging an amenity fee for a pool is ridiculous.","Thank you for staying with us! Glad you enjoyed our bathrooms and large showers.

Grafton on Sunset,20,"We bought, we taught it was a good deal. However, hidden expensive costs are to be added! The use of the pool and the WIFI are charged $20.99 extra and you have no choice but to take them. Our room was facing a wall!!!! I am serious, it is kinda underground, so facing a wall and the street above! At least they should paint the wall or plan stuff, just to make it feel less of a prison.The daily parking price is also outrageous (43$/day)! and on top there is a 3.29 fee tax.

Grafton on Sunset,30,"This hotel is perfectly located on sunset that is really the best point.The patio with the pool is very nice. A quiet gem in the middle of the crowded city.Reading the hotel bio, the place has been renovated. In my opinion the rooms we were staying at needed another phase of renovation : one of them had a musty odour. Bathroom aren’t up-to-date at all and the huge problem is isolation : we can hear everything from the room beside and when I say everything I mean EVERYTHING. We didn’t had a very warmth contact with staff, freezing cold was more appropriate, one of the girl at the reception was eating her pizza when we arrived.In fact the problem of the hotel is it’s claims in term of rates and the actual real standing of the hotel. In fact all those little bad aspects didn’t ruined our stay at all but when you pay a certain price they bump at your eyes more. Anyway I still recommend this place for short stays as it is practical, clean with good bedding and a nice pool.","Thank you for staying with us and for taking the time to share your recent stay.

When I arrived at the hotel I had to wait 20min for valet parking in a very difficult spot because of the construction out front.

Grafton on Sunset,20,"The Grafton has no right to call itself a hotel. The well appointed lobby bar, restaurant and fancy name is where the positives end.I checked in to an indifferent, unsmiling man at reception. Being a solo female traveler, I did not love the idea that my room was located at the end of a long dark carpeted deserted hallway on the 2nd floor. Note: in this hotel the lobby is floor 3, so you go down a floor for 2 and down two floors for 1.Upon entering the room, it smelled overwhelmingly and sickeningly like bleach. The carpet had also been scrubbed with foul smelling chemicals AND the window would not open. I called reception who sent a handyman, he helped open the window to the maximum of 2 inches that insurance allows them to do.There is a lot wrong with this property. I’m surprised at the (misleadingly) good reviews that precede mine. Some of the highlights are:1. Super slow or NO WiFi during a 3 night stay. Hotel has a separate “amenity” charge for this no/slow WiFi and “other” amenities.This was a huge problem for me as a business traveller. They claimed to restart router several times but made no difference.2. No breakfast options. Kitchen opens at 12 pm.3. Surly and unconcerned staff overall. Needs basic hospitality training. I returned from a shopping trip (the only day I had to shop on a business trip) with around 9 shopping bags that would be physically impossible for me to carry to my room. I requested the idle bell captain to let me use his cart to take these to my room. He stood by the cart looking into the distance as I unloaded the back of the taxi on to his cart. He resentfully pushed the cart one floor down and a 2 minute walk to my room. He only cheered up when I tipped him for all his “efforts”.4. At night you can hear the sounds and thuds of everyone walking in the lobby floor above.Overall I felt grossly misled in proportion to the rate I paid.And to top it all off, see this sign outside the hotel:","We are sorry that you did not have a pleasant experience as we want everyone to experience the Grafton is a positive way. Your comments have all been issued and handled. So there is no confusion to other readers, our internet is complimentary while high-speed has a fee.

So far everything good.When we arrived at the hotel we met an receptionist who didn’t seem to like her job. I stay a lot in hotels and a great hotel according to me are the hotels that the staff are glad to see me. I’m not talking about putting me on a pedestal but just making me feel welcome.

Yes there is a free wi-fi at the hotel but it’s really slow and works when it feels like it. You can get faster speed but you have to pay for this which I never did since the speed only was one of the problems. There is something wrong when the guests have to find the nearest Starbucks or Coffee & beans to be able to read the emails from their children, looking something up on the internet or read the news from home.And according to the reception you are only allowed three units per room on the wi-if.

Grafton on Sunset,10,"Let me start by saying that I wouldn’t wish the expierence I had at this hotel on anyone.We arrived at the grafton on 3/10 late in the evening. My boyfriend showed the lady working the frontdesk his ID. She said she won’t accept his PASSPORT because it ”doesn’t look like him” (he had longer hair thats all) what is she the US State or border patrol?? So my boyfriend went back all the way to the car and got his drivers license, again the woman said that the picture doesn’t look like him and started giving us a really bad attitude, start interrogation us saying we “stole” the passport etc...she was definitely just taunting us. She made my boyfriend walk to the car A SECOND TIME (it was raining) and while he was gone she loudly made fun of my boyfriends appearance with her coworker. My boyfriend came back with his State ID which she suddenly accepted...she started checking us in. Everything was paid for except the daily deposit. Unfortunately, my boyfriends credit card wouldn’t go through, mostly probably because he has a international CC, so I asked her if she could use my credit card instead she said that wasn’t possible (even though it was all she had to do was give her superior a quick call). She told us that we had to call the european expedia so that they can put my name on the room and that we can’t check in until we did that. I told her that I won’t be able to reach anyone there right now because its 3am in europe. But she wouldn't even listen to me all she said was “excuuusseee me” in the most sassy way, turned around and started talking and laughing with some random guy. I again, tried talking to her but she would just ignore us. It was late at night, we had no place to go, we werent from the area and the best part I am still underaged. I called my dad and told him exactly what happend. He called the hotel amd the woman picked up the phone. She was all fake and really rude she said “ noo your daughter is lying that is not what happend at all” (which I wasnt, my boyfriend can proof that too). She walked into a room with the telephone and was gone for 5 min. She came back with the fakest “I’m about to kill you smile”, I’m not even kidding her smile scared me and told me ok I’m going to accept your credit card now. Ohhh so it wasnt that hard huh...? She lied to us the whole time. She put us into a room directly next to the bar it was so extremely loud we couldn’t sleep until 2am. The room was extremely dirty and not well kept at all. Our “view” was a wall and a few wires. The window sills haven’t been cleaned in years. We slept in our clothes on top of our bedsheets because the bedsheets had brown stains on them and were overall dirty. There was also some random brown goey ball on the floor next to the bed (I really dont want to know what that was). The bathroom was dirty aswell. We woke up at 5 am to the sound of people talking (the room doors are way too thin and not isolated at all). We could have asked for a new room but We just wanted to leave. We checked out that morning and I am so happy we did, we were supposed to stay 7 nights. But one night was definitely enough, that night was so bad that me and my boyfriend were debating if we should take the next best flight home and sleep in the car for a night if we have too, but luckily we found a different hotel that was cheaper, even though it was a five star hotel and the president stayed there at the same time which was a interesting experience.I just really want to say that I have never been treated like that by any hotel staff or never in general.

Grafton on Sunset,30,"The hotel is really good, especially for the price, compared to other hotels in the area. Nice place, nice rooms, cool pool, very good location. The problem is that there’s one or two guys working the breakfast when there should be a few. They are very friendly and nice, but often got small parts of our order wrong, and we ordered pretty much the same thing 4 days in a row. It took no less than a full 90 minutes for us to get in and out of breakfast every day. It took FOREVER to get a menu, to get a coffee (I think it took my husband at least 30 mins to get just a coffee daily), to get served in general. It was painful, and with our hungry four-year-old, the delay resulted in hunger tantrums almost each of the mornings.

I requested a manager, but was given to another clerk, as no manager was on site, that did not know about the room as she had never been in it.

Walls must be really thin. I also forgot about the recreational smoking being legal around there and we smelled it quite often in the halls. We only had a view of an alley also. Our second room was better but could still slightly hear the people next door to us. We did end up changing to a 1 night stay instead of 2, opted for Santa Monica instead.On a positive note, the bartender was super nice and got us a quick meal on our way to the Luzia Cirque Du Soleil show!!",Thank you for your review.

Grafton on Sunset,20,"The hotel lobby is beautiful. The room was well decorated, but the curtain was old and dirty. When we walked in the suite it smelled like vomit. I called the desk and they sent someone up to check, They agreed on the smell. They said they would come and spray, but that only masks the odor and my son is asthmatic so that wouldn't work, I opened the windows to air out the smell and we left to go eat. When we came back the smell was a little better. i got into bed and it smelled like vomit as well. Yuck, they changed my bedding but I still went to sleep on the sofa bed, They need to give this hotel a good cleaning! it is in a wonderful location, but I am not advising it until they fix this issue.

Grafton on Sunset,20,"Arrived on 20th December for 3 nights and welcomed with a free drink! Great we thought until you came to redeem it - only ""house"" spirits - so no JD or Hendricks gin. I guess one should be grateful given the price of alcohol in California. We were also told at check in how to log on to the internet and the password - again, expecting this to be included in the price we paid up front - wait until check out time!. All went well on the first night but after a full day's sight seeing around LA we returned to the hotel around 9 pm and the stench of weed coming from the room 2 doors away was unbearable. Baring in mind we were in room 307, near to reception, there was no excuse. You could smell it at the front door to the hotel! This is despite there being a notice in each room stating a $500 fine for smoking in the room!! The smell was sill lingering next morning. Day/night 3 seemed to be uneventful until 2am in the morning when we were awakened by several residents running up and down the corridor shouting to each other, running back to get glasses from reception so they could continue drinking in their room. I'm guessing there were between 4-6 guests.Come to check out and then found out about the Amenity Tax!! $20.00 per day for the ""free"" WiFi and the pool we didn't use - an out door pool in the middle of winter!! When challenged about the noise, the smell of weed and the ""hidden"" costs we were offered the contact number for the duty manager and the charges were ""non-negotiable"".

This is shady, and this hotel knows it.TOO CLOSE TO THE SUNSET STRIP: my wife and I decided that we didn't really like being *on* the sunset strip.

Grafton on Sunset,30,"The Grafton itself was fine though this should serve as fair warning to not partner with or use Travelocity for any of your hotel bookings.The Grafton - clean, had to switch rooms because electricity and tv on one wall did not work, room service was relatively quick and food was good except we had to call back because they forgot to bring the salad. Called for extra blankets. Had to call again and was told they ran out. Received another call back to say they only had one blanket instead of two.Considering this was NYE, the Grafton did their best.Travelocity on the other hand wasted four hours of our vacation time due to a botched reservation which landed us at the Grafton. While the two are separate events, it’s a lesson for us not use travel service aggregators. When something goes wrong, Travelocity won’t fix it. Five agents later, not completely satisfied with their resolution as they will only provide a $50 credit toward a future service. No, thanks.

Grafton on Sunset,30,"First, the good: the hotel is located in a fantastic area with great restaurants and entertainment options. The staff are courteous and prompt. This is my second stay; I stayed here 5 years ago and booked again based on that stay but ultimately wish I’d looked elsewhere.The not so great: we had air conditioning issues the first evening and our door actually didn’t lock, which is a massive security issue. To their credit, maintenance fixed both problems very quickly.The worst is the “resort fee”. We were charged about $23 USD a day for things such as wi-fi, pool access, water bottles and “complimentary welcome drinks”. We were told we would receive two free water bottles in our room daily but after the first night they had price tags of $4.50 USD on them so we only got two bottles of water for the “resort fee” we paid. Given that we only really used the wi-fi, this is an exorbitant and infuriating fee to be presented with upon check-out. Here’s a tip for the hotel: raise your prices $23 a night and include these amenities for “free”. This would go down a lot better than receiving a bill at the end of a very busy vacation. This alone prevents me from recommending this hotel to LA visitors.",Thank you for your review. I hope that you may give us another chance to create an enjoyable stay for you.

Grafton on Sunset,10,"I created a trip advisor account just to review this hotel it was that terrible! Where do I begin ? We travelled from Sydney, Australia to our first overseas trip to America and we though the Grafton on Sunset would be a beautiful hotel to stay at. Located in West Hollywood the describe themselves as a ‘chic’ hotel. But the parts they leave out-When arriving at the reception desk, don’t expect to be greeted kindly. We were met by a young man who was rude and seemed to have no idea what he was doing.Once checked into our rooms, which were understandably small as it is a prime location we noticed in the bathroom the toilet was impossible to sit on comfortably ! Positioned hard up against the shower screen and vanity even a small child would struggle to do there business and what is with no bin liners in all of the bins ??The layout was not well thought out at all.Secondly, whilst unpacking my suitcase I noticed shards of glass on the floor, which would be a hazard to anyone kneeling on the floor or even walking on it. Speaking of the house keeping, we were greeted by a bit so friendly would with a 8am knock on our door to ask if we wanted our room cleaned then and there, as I did open the door in my sleepwear I asked if she could come back later on. She never returned. A complaint was raised with reception that we were unhappy with the cleanliness of both the rooms we booked including rubbish not taken out over two days and towels not being replaced, we were told “ the manager will have to be notified “ we didn’t hear anything back after that. House cleaning were not doing there job at all !On the second day we arrived back to our hotel, bags of shopping in hand we noticed the entire lock on our door had been changed without notice, the reasoning from maintenance? Because they had too, not to mention our room door was left unlocked and unattended by maintenance, with all our belongings in the room. When reception was told they ensured nothing could have gone wrong, and provided a $15 drink voucher .the following day after the door lock type had been changed our key along with other individuals on the same floor seemed to also be having issues with there’s not working which required another visit to reception. This list could go on and on as this is just a small amount of issues we encountered. I would not recommend this hotel to anyone !",We are sorry you had a poor experience.

We booked the hotel online, and once we checked in, we were told there was an amenity charge - although we never used the pool. We were given two ticket stubs for free drinks at their bar. Unfortunately, it wasn't explained that they were only for wine or beer as we were anticipating something like mojito. Additionally, the bartender was not even friendly.

Grafton on Sunset,10,"Stayed in the hotel with my colleague for 6 nights and was extremely disappointed with it.I’ve been to many hotels and Grafton makes its way to the top chart of “worse service”.Reception was more than once not occupied when we needed it and we had to wait couple minutes for someone to come.Same case was with the Bar/restaurant but then when the waiter (L) did show up he was rude and aggressive that I had to complain to the hotel’s management about him. There was only one nice waiter (C) at the bar but he served us only once.The pool was open but as you can see in the photo part of it was under construction so part of it was closed and there were people working there.Elevator stopped working one afternoon so we found ourselves climbing the stairs from first floor to the third couple of times.As for that, we were placed on the first floor which is the lower level facing parking lot/ sidewalk. Not ideal at all; We had spider in the bathroom and ants and could also hear any movement of our neighbours from the higher level.One day of our stay they decided to close the patio too without further notice of when they’re going to reopen it.Location is not as great as I thought it was. If you are looking for more restaurants/ clubs you better find something in WeHo but on Melrose or Santa Monica.When i shared my disappointmentwith the receptionist he only said “ok?!” and cared less about us or the satisfaction of our stay.Since this is not cheap hotel, I would not recommend you to stay there.","Dear Guest,Thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Grafton on Sunset,10,"I stayed here in end of July 2017. I was ripped off by their scam and ended up disputing the claim via my credit card which was successful since Grafton was wrong.I'm from UK. All my charges were paid for by my holiday agent for many hotels i had booked as a package throughout California and Las Vegas. Every other hotel was perfect and great service, but not this one.Although my card was blocked when we checked in with a high charge (see other reviewers with same problem) they told me everything was paid for but this was if i had anything from the bar.Upon checking out we were told to pay the extortionate rip off parking at $42 per night. Then we were told to pay for the internet which we were told was free. I refused to pay the internet and was only happy to pay the parking. When i refused, the lady on front desk was VERY RUDE and said i had to pay. I told her i refused to sign the invoice and will contact my card bank. She said, hang on, clicked on the computer and said, too late i have just taken payment and i could do nothing about it. How rude and arrogant. She had a smirk on her face which i told her that she will regret and not be paid. Very very rude indeed and cocky attitude.I managed to block the payment within 24 hours by ringing my bank and my bank has refused to pay them since i showed the proof and documentation. It took me 2 months to get this sorted with my credit card bank. Bet that grin is wiped off her face now.Of course the management will reply to this and make an excuse. Too late. I did say to her that i wanted to sort this out and gave them the opportunity there and then, but she refused. Infact the manager stood next to her and did not bother at all. They just wanted the money.About the room> Room was nice, but we had a family room and they failed to understand there were 4 people in our family. So, they left us 2 cups and 2 sugars. Well i had to tell them on several occasions for extra cups, extra milk, extra sugars etc, They just did not understand this. We got fed up and went over to Mels Diner for some great drinks and food.ALL the rooms face a brick wall and there's very loud music all night with Sky Bar next door.Won't be staying here again and i have now started to tell many others on social media about his scam and rip off hotel.BEWARE > Make sure you have a good credit card company who will back you up and fight against this crooked management at Grafton.We stayed across California and Las Vegas for 3 weeks and every hotel and service was great.

Grafton on Sunset,20,"I was welcomed to the hotel by live music coming from the bar but my stay turned south quickly afterwards, unfortunately.Arriving in room 218, I discovered that the windows face a brick wall: not great but after all, I'm here to sleep, so no big deal.More problematic, even though it was nearly 10pm, there was a lot of noise coming from above my room: loud bangs as if someone was moving furniture on tiles as well as some sort of machinery doing a massive noise every 30s or so. (I thought for a while I was next to the elevator machine room)After 15 minutes of this I decided to call the front desk. I was told this wasn't supposed to continue all night and that someone would come to my room. This is when I learned that the restaurant was above my room and they were apparently cleaning everything and running loud appliances, all of which reverberated into my room. Fortunately they made them stop (or they were finished, since it was 10:30pm by then).First night: bad start.The following night, I came back very late and didn't have any noise issue but was awoken at 5pm: same loud noise of furniture being moved or stuff dropping on the floor. At 6am, the loud noise from appliances started for a little while.I can't understand why after a $10MM renovation such a thing happens but I certainly feel cheated that I had to endure it. After the first night, I was hoping this was a 1-time thing and was not prepared for this to awake me at 5am the next day. It is obvious that the hotel staff is aware of the problem but they didn't offer any solution to me, aside from... ear plugs!After my checkout, since the lady at the front desk didn't mention these issues or ask me about my stay, I raised the problem again and was just awarded a shrug with a smile and a mild apology. I will certainly not return to this hotel after this experience, where I had 2 bad nights for the price of a 4 star hotel.Some additional facts:- Parking is $42 / 24h (or night)- Breakfast service was poor: it took 20 minutes to get 2 toasts and a granola yogurt (for $19 with tax and tip) while there were 5 people in the room.- Pool area is nice and many rooms have a view on it",Thank you for taking time to let us know about your experience.

Grafton on Sunset,30,"Stayed here for 2 nights as part of a west coast road trip. It has left me feeling that it is a bit of style over substance. The public areas of bar and restaurant and the pool area have obviously had a lot of money spend on them and it shows....really funky.The room on the other hand was not quite what I was expecting for the price paid. I had a top floor ""suite""....I'm not sure how it can be described as a suite as it was a small room with a long corridor to the bathroom (plus stains on the carpet - a bit of a no no in a hotel like this). If you are a person that is easily bothered by noise then this might not be the hotel for you...when the people in the next door room took a shower, you can hear the water rushing through the pipes, the floorboards creak so you would want a room on the top floor plus you are right on the strip so traffic noise can be a problem if your room is at the front of the hotel. I also had an air con unit outside the room which made quite a bit of noise.However, what I will say is that the bed was super comfortable and the bathroom nicely done. The staff were really friendly too. So if you want a modern boutique hotel and don't mind noise then you'll like this hotel.","Thank you for choosing the Grafton and taking time to write a review.

Grafton on Sunset,20,Not a warm welcome (I landed very late and was really tired and had to wait so long to check in) - a lot of noise in the rooms and a terrible smell - restaurant with a poor selection.

Grafton on Sunset,10,"I would not recommend this so called hotel even to my worst enemy. The noise in the hotel is beyond bearable. The walls are so thin I can hear the person next door conversations, snoring, farting, sneezing....After complaining about the noise, the security guard could care less about the noise even going so far to say it's normal for a hotel. Sorry guy but never had noise issue like this in any hotels I've ever stayed at.The pool is a joke, always shaded no sun light whatsoever. Don't do valet parking as there are cheaper options 2 blocks away.(they won't tell you this so be sure to research the area) Service at the pool is like life on Mars, it was nonexistent.Only good thing about the hotel would be the location but I wouldn't go that far to say it was worth it to stay here because of the location.",Thank you for taking time to let us know of your experience and we apologize we did not meet your expectations.,Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: February 2017,"Response from Bert S, General Manager at Grafton on Sunset","Responded Feb 24, 2017"
Grafton on Sunset,30,"We stayed here for three nights and was residing on the second floor. This is a modern hotel and it looks trendy. However, the rooms have thin walls which means you can hear the conversations, the snores or your neighbor, foot steps from upstairs etc. At 11:45 pm, we made a complaint because we can hear the TV blasted next door. (We could not sleep with this loud thrashing noise). They indicated that security will investigate. After 15 minutes, we made a second call downstairs and was advised security stated he could not hear anything in the hallways. Therefore, we requested for security to come into our room and listen for himself. He did come into the room and noted that he did hear the loud TV and promised to go next door to advise the individual about the noise complaint. The sounds did not change and around 12ish am, he knocked on our door and gave us a room on the first floor ground level. (Please note that when we originally requested for this the operator stated the hotel was ""sold out."") We agreed and packed our stuff happily. When we got to the ground floor room immediately upon entering we could hear the loud laughters, and conversations next door and then immediately requested to return to our second floor room. Indeed, we returned upstairs. I much rather hear TV thrashing then conversations amongst a group of individuals.The pool area is nice and I relaxed there twice except the sun does not hit the area much. The sunlight goes in and out. It gets shady probably due to the location. Also, there was construction next door and in the pool area you can hear the demolition.This morning around 630ish/7AM the men were cleaning the pool and we could hear their chatter and water running. We do sleep with the windows open. Upon checkout today, I notice the receptionist checking a guest in and spoke about the discounts in the hotel bar/restaurant. We received none of those offers when we entered. In addition, when I told her about our stay because she asked, she was not sympathetic about our stay and disregarded my comment.Also, UBER everything. The taxi to the hotels was 50$ but UBER was less expensive depending on the time (avoid rush hour for cheaper deals). We used UBER for our entire stay and traveled between, LA, Santa Monica, Beverly Hills, Downtown etc. We car pooled and it was worth it due to the amount of time we were in California.",Thank you for taking time to let us know about your experience at our hotel.

Grafton on Sunset,20,"I really wanted to like this hotel. The photos are incredible and the reviews come back quite good. Which is why we booked it.However, the experience was quite different. Going back and reading the reviews now, the overwhelmingly positive ones seem to be about the area and accessibility, which the more... critical... reviews are about the hotel itself.I would not stay here again, nor would I recommend it to anyone else – given the number of great hotels in Los Angeles and this area specifically.1 – The wifi is terrible. They say ""free wifi"", and that is technically true. There is a low 1MB bandwidth connection available for free. However, that is shared amongst all people and devices attached through a single email address. We had four devices, and didn't realise that was the limit until the second day.Worse, the person at the front desk had no idea how the system worked. She said I could use the Wifi signal from the bar. Which was weak and slow from the room.This is the first hotel I have ever stayed at where I felt tricked by the wifi offer. It said ""free"" and it was barely functional. Either tell me it's extra – in which case I look for another hotel – or give me a usable signal for free.2 – The whole ""Hollywood glam"" decor is accurate. That this is a popular Hollywood hotel is not. The bar and restaurant were generally deserted. There is a pool, that is true. However, there is also loud music that plays to the pool at all waking hours of the day. Nice to open the window and hear music if you're in the mood for it. But Justin Bieber on repeat for two days does wear.3 – Parking is atrocious. They charge $50 to park the car in a lot behind the hotel, and further offer no help with offsite parking. Again, something unseen. I have been to hotels in Los Angeles, where the hotel has arranged offsite parking. With this one, not only were they a bit predatory about it, but the first valet threatened to have me ticketed in the loading zone when I asked if there were any options.4 – This hotel has no unique proposition. It doesn't do anything really well for the price. We used Booking.com, and got a decent rate – not a good rate – but that was the same rate as great hotels in both Venice and Downtown LA. While the Sunset Strip is generally expensive, for $25 - $50 more a night, one can have a great experience across the street or down the road a bit.I can see no reason to recommend this hotel in any manner, except potentially to people who want to live a vague simulacrum of the Hollywood glamour thing at quite a high price.","Thank you for taking time to let us know about your experience. We apologize if you felt we were not upfront about wifi services, but we do offer a basic wifi service for free with options if more bandwidth is needed. With respect to parking, our parking charges are $40 per night, not $50 as you indicated and unfortunately parking is at a premium in West Hollywood with no convenient alternative option available. I apologize if you felt the valet was trying to have you ticketed by parking in the loading zone, but they were trying to protect you from getting a ticket as the City of West Hollywood is very aggressive in patrolling the Sunset Strip and will give a ticket if someone is only over 1 to 2 minutes of the allotted 5 minute parking.",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: December 2016,"Response from Bert S, General Manager at Grafton on Sunset","Responded Jan 5, 2017"
Grafton on Sunset,20,"My family and I stayed at the Grafton for 14 nights over winter break. I would NOT recommend coming here with children, or for a quiet, restful trip. The other guests at the hotel were ROUDY beyond belief, partying all night every night. The walls were paper thin which didnt help. At very least, avoid the rooms on the first floor at all costs, as they echo noise from the entire hotel.The housekeeping was SERIOUSLY inconsistent. Sometimes they would clean the bathroom, somtimes they wouldent. Sometimes they brought new water bottles, sometimes they didnt. The worst part about the housekeeping was on multiple occasions the keepers carts STANK terribly, and were wreaking up the halls, AND THE ROOMS AFTER SERVICE. it was intolerable.We called months in advance to book 4 rooms for 2 weeks (big family vacation) and the representative had assured us some of the best rooms on the top floor with a grand view for which we were quoted a price. We were then notified she was fired and a new manager was handling our room block. He stuck us in the basement rooms, charged us the same price, and the day we checked in, left on a vacation of his own.A plus was that the place is good if you're young and here to party. The location is the best part, its seriously prime real estate. The valet and reception were friendly and professional. however there are a few other hotels in the near proximity that would offer better value.",Thank you for taking time to let us know how we did.

The room looks like it was recently decorated.However, we were given a room in the lower level (basement) as suggested by check-in to avoid noise disturbance from the bar and it smelled a bit musky in the hallways.For the price $250 this is a good option if you are not spending much time in the hotel.",Thank you for letting us know about your stay.

The bed was not made, the room was not cleaned and the toiletries were not replaced. Also, the bathroom was small and the TV channels were not synced properly.There is a cool bar onsite, with some entertainment on one of the nights we stayed.

Grafton on Sunset,20,"First, Expedia (at least) has incorrect information on the Deposit. They have $100/stay, but it is actually $100/day. That's obviously a big difference when you're staying 3+ nights. It wasn't a big deal, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time that the hotel would be freezing $400.Second, valet parking is mandatory, and it's $40/night, and they will look at you every time you get your vehicle, expecting a tip. Maybe the Midwest is a little behind on the times, but I'm not tipping you when I'm already paying $40/night for you to park my car.Third, the staff was awful, except one of the attendants who was fantastic (I didn't catch his name), and the bartender I saw twice seemed to be a pretty cool guy as well (also didn't get his name). The rest could be done without. The front desk always appeared to be too busy to help, or even speak, to me, and relatively rude; and only one young woman even acknowledged my presence when I walked through the lobby.Fourth, the food and drinks are incredibly overpriced. I get it, it's W Hollywood, but for the amount of food, it's quality, and the quality of the drinks, it's not worth it at all. The menu was super small as well, and the options were OK, but you better be looking for modern dining, otherwise you'll be out of luck.Fifth, the room left something to be desired. There was literally ZERO view. My view for the four days was a concrete wall and a rickety wooden fence just a couple feet outside my window. The room overall wasn't too small, but it could have been slightly larger. No chair to sit in (except the desk chair); the bathroom was nice, but tiny; windows didn't open at all; no curtains, but shutters (that were installed backwards!); bed was nothing special; and the TV channel selection was awful. The minibar was well stocked, but just go across the street to the Pink Dot or down Sunset to one of the liquor stores, and buy something for much cheaper.Sixth, the wifi was a joke. The basic was free, but it was like 3G mobile service, and wasn't even strong enough to keep my laptop connected to it. I ended up using my data almost the entire four days. I refused to pay for the upgrade ($9.99/night), so I can't speak to it's quality.Lastly, there was construction right next door. They are building two high-rises, and the construction noise was terrible. I unfortunately had unpleasant weather for my trip, and was stuck inside a little bit more than I had wanted, and that's all I heard. Machinery, jackhammers, air tools, large trucks, constantly.I wouldn't say this is a great hotel, and have stayed in better in LA.

Grafton on Sunset,10,"I am horrified by the service to traveller of this hotel. Having been travelling through the US and Mexico I have returned to Sydney with my partner staying on for an additional few days. Just prior to my partner returning home (2 days prior!) his bank blocked his cards. I booked his last nights accommodation from Sydney using my credit card. When my partner arrived at the hotel they would NOT accept his check in as they would not accept CASH for a security deposit OR a scanned and emailed copy of my credit card and passport. They literally REFUSED to assist passing me to the booking agent (Expedia) to try to obtain a refund or alternative accommodation. I am absolutely HORRIFIED that a hotel would turn a traveller away who is obviously in a terrible situation, who has actually paid for the accommodation without assisting to find a resolution. The reservation manager in particular was extremely rude.

Grafton on Sunset,30,"Really wanted to like this hotel but it fell short in a couple of areas for me.

Grafton on Sunset,20,"First, Expedia (at least) has incorrect information on the Deposit. They have $100/stay, but it is actually $100/day. That's obviously a big difference when you're staying 3+ nights. It wasn't a big deal, but it would have been nice to know ahead of time that the hotel would be freezing $400.Second, valet parking is mandatory, and it's $40/night, and they will look at you every time you get your vehicle, expecting a tip. Maybe the Midwest is a little behind on the times, but I'm not tipping you when I'm already paying $40/night for you to park my car.Third, the staff was awful, except one of the attendants who was fantastic (I didn't catch his name), and the bartender I saw twice seemed to be a pretty cool guy as well (also didn't get his name). The rest could be done without. The front desk always appeared to be too busy to help, or even speak, to me, and relatively rude; and only one young woman even acknowledged my presence when I walked through the lobby.Fourth, the food and drinks are incredibly overpriced. I get it, it's W Hollywood, but for the amount of food, it's quality, and the quality of the drinks, it's not worth it at all. The menu was super small as well, and the options were OK, but you better be looking for modern dining, otherwise you'll be out of luck.Fifth, the room left something to be desired. There was literally ZERO view. My view for the four days was a concrete wall and a rickety wooden fence just a couple feet outside my window. The room overall wasn't too small, but it could have been slightly larger. No chair to sit in (except the desk chair); the bathroom was nice, but tiny; windows didn't open at all; no curtains, but shutters (that were installed backwards!); bed was nothing special; and the TV channel selection was awful. The minibar was well stocked, but just go across the street to the Pink Dot or down Sunset to one of the liquor stores, and buy something for much cheaper.Sixth, the wifi was a joke. The basic was free, but it was like 3G mobile service, and wasn't even strong enough to keep my laptop connected to it. I ended up using my data almost the entire four days. I refused to pay for the upgrade ($9.99/night), so I can't speak to it's quality.Lastly, there was construction right next door. They are building two high-rises, and the construction noise was terrible. I unfortunately had unpleasant weather for my trip, and was stuck inside a little bit more than I had wanted, and that's all I heard. Machinery, jackhammers, air tools, large trucks, constantly.I wouldn't say this is a great hotel, and have stayed in better in LA.

Grafton on Sunset,10,"I am horrified by the service to traveller of this hotel. Having been travelling through the US and Mexico I have returned to Sydney with my partner staying on for an additional few days. Just prior to my partner returning home (2 days prior!) his bank blocked his cards. I booked his last nights accommodation from Sydney using my credit card. When my partner arrived at the hotel they would NOT accept his check in as they would not accept CASH for a security deposit OR a scanned and emailed copy of my credit card and passport. They literally REFUSED to assist passing me to the booking agent (Expedia) to try to obtain a refund or alternative accommodation. I am absolutely HORRIFIED that a hotel would turn a traveller away who is obviously in a terrible situation, who has actually paid for the accommodation without assisting to find a resolution. The reservation manager in particular was extremely rude. Meanwhile after an hour on the phone the lady from Expedia who was also horrified about our situation re organised the booking at Mondrian Hotel who happily took electronic confirmation and book my partner in immediately.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,30,"I recently stayed at the property for a conference and found the hotel had good and bad aspects. The good, is the property is pretty new, clean, the rooms are comfortable, and the included breakfast was nice. The bad is they were just not prepared for the crowd from the conference. Our ""guaranteed 4:00 check-in"" was not guaranteed. We arrived after a long and arduous travel day at about 3:30. Forget about checking in 30 minutes early, we couldn't even get to our room until 4:30. It may not sound like much, but after a long day, and we were anxious to get to our conference having lost half a day to flight delays, to lose another hour because we could not get into our room was disappointing. We were finally given a room which was right next to the elevator. It wasn't too noisy, but these are usually the worst rooms and could have been bad with late night guests passing by.Then our room was not cleaned the following day. Maid service finally showed up but it was nearly 5 and we were already back in the room and didn't want to be disturbed.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,10,"I will start with the background. Just so that fellow traveler could have a better understanding. I am a 6 year Platinum member. Translate into their new membership system Platinum Premier/Titanium, which is considerably high in their new ranking just below Ambassador. Now, this is something about the property. It is not a fancy luxury hotel. However, Marriott just moved the property's category to 5 out of 8(8 as in St. Regis NYC). Also by the time I was booking it, it was around $600 dollars a night. I booked with points. This shouldn't have any effect on the reservation nor their service.When we checked in, he told me ""we have upgraded you to a higher floor (same room type) per your membership status."" First of all, that's not an upgrade no matter how you put it. It is my basic requirement. If you are a Marriott member, talk to the front desk to make sure your preference is satisfied such as no feather or extra towel etc. Check-in process was smooth and all since I did mobile check-in already. We got in the room fine. The room was what we expected, a normal Residence Inn. Then the most unpleasant stay in my Marriott life started.1. Noise. The hotel has a thin wall to start with. You can hear other guest tapping or randomly knocking on the wall, floor, or furniture as well as the sound of closing wardrobes. For 3 out of my 5 days stay, I have heard this beeping in the wall constantly. It's not too loud that it's intolerable but it's there.2. The cleanliness. You would think a prominent hotel chain would at least throw out the overused sheets with holes and stains on them. No, they don't. You can see holes in the sheet and stains on the pillowcase.3. The bedding. This is the most unpleasant part of this trip. There are two parts to it.FIRST, do you mind getting an actual duvet cover? Putting the duvet in between two flat sheets is not a cover, no, not even in a low tier brand hotel. Let alone that Marriott just raised the category of this hotel to 5. You might think why is it a big deal. Because they don't change the duvet but only the sheets! With as light as a duvet they have, it is really easy to have your bare skin to make contact with their everlasting (not changed) duvet. And by the way, the duvet is yellowish.SECOND, apparently, they just implemented a new bedding system. After the first night, I found my fitted sheet and mattress pad all scrambled together leaving me sleeping right on top of the mattress without anything in between me and the actual mattress. I thought maybe I slept to...intensively? It happened again the second day. Then I realized it only take a small action such as lying down for those fitted sheets to retract all the way up and dragging the mattress cover. So I called the housekeeping. While I was watching the hard working housekeeping putting the bed together, I learned this information from her. Apparently, they just changed the mattress pad that causes the faulty fitting with the rest of the bedding. The housekeeping has had a really hard time to keep it in place. It is just not a single incident but happened a lot in general. It is not the situation that I can try to last overnight. You will find yourself on the mattress directly so much if you just turn the other way. Again, mind you the mattress is not the subject to be cleaned and changed after every guest. So long story short, I had to corner myself for five days. My husband has been sleeping without a sheet under him most of the time.4. The so-called ""business service"". If you are traveling for business, don't bother staying here. You will be much better off staying across the street at JW. You would say, "" Of course, JW is just a higher tier of a brand than Residence Inn."" Note: The price of this hotel by the time I booked it was around $600 a night. I went down trying to ship a package, which is included in the business service. Their front desk staff doesn't seem like to have dealt with this situation a lot. They can't get the Fedex process straight. You are much better off to just use a Fedex Drop-off Box than going there. The most you can expect from them is a computer in the ""business center"".And Andrew, please look at me as you are talking to me! It is a very basic manner when you work in hospitality. I am having an inquiry about the service you are providing. I am no less of a person or customer than the other lady who is in the line. Imagine a staff member focusing on the screen or other people and answering you as if you are not there while you are asking a question.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,30,I would have given it a good rating but there is no option in Tripadvisor.Its a business hotel with great location. Last time we stayed in Millennium Biltmore where the service was very fast.The best thing about this hotel is its proximity to LA Live and Nokia Theatre and also other places.The only thing in disliked is that this hotel does not provide room slippers at all. And people can travel continents for days to be in meetings and most of the times we dont carry room slippers. Please if someone is listening do provide room slippers and it will help a lot.Also the rooms are little smaller but then for a meeting one comes to the room only to sleep. We stayed in one of the rooms just above the pool from where the morning sun was shining bright on the Hollywood Sign. Quite a good sight from the room.Staff is cool and friendly at the reception and the small pick up shop at the lobby is very convenient for small snacks at odd hours. The hotel is totally secure and safe and thats the best thing about it.Overall good place but needs a little personal touch from the management. But then its too busy as people keep coming here so maybe thats why the personal touch has gone missing. No complaints though. Would love to stay again and will bring slippers next time.,"Thank you very much for taking the time to share your review! I recognize that you have many brands to choose from and we appreciate that you selected us! I will make sure to share your positive feedback with the necessary departments. Thank you for providing suggestions for room slippers, I have passed on the information and request to our Housekeeping department.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,20,"My family and I stayed here for 2 nights. The property is made up of both The Residence Inn and The Courtyard. I booked The Residence Inn months in advance. Unfortunately, we encountered 2 issues during our stay. Issue # 1: At the time of check in, I inquired about using my points with Marriott's Instant Redemption Program ( I had read on-line that they do participate with this program). The front desk clerk did not know anything about it and said that they do not participate. Issue # 2: At the time of booking, I saw that they provide a FREE hot breakfast. Unfortunately, I had forgotten this fact. As a result, my family and I spent $70.00 for a mediocre breakfast at the Lobby's take out restaurant. I addressed this issue upon check out but the front desk clerk was unable to help me. He advised that he would have a manager call me. Manager never called. My family left and moved on to our other vacation destinations. I called and followed-up with the manager who advised that he sent me an email (I had not read it, as I was on vacation). The manager advised that they could not credit my debit card for the $70 breakfast as he was confident that their associate communicated to me about the free breakfast information (she did not). He also could not credit my card as the lobby restaurant was with the Courtyard not the Residence Inn...um, there is no line drawn, nor signs indicating where Courtyard begins and Residence Inn ends. Instead the offer was to give me additional Marriott reward points. I advised that I was not satisfied with this and requested a credit to my card. I also asked about the instant redemption program that I was unable to take advantage of during my stay. He could not help me with either of my concerns. He said that he would check into it and call me back. He never did. Clearly this Marriott has management issues. It seems the $70 was more valuable to them then making a customer happy. I suggest increased training for your associates and managers. Marriott sure missed out on an opportunity to make good on a couple of simple issues to satisfy their customer.","Hello,Thank you for taking the time to share your valuable feedback.

Lots of touristy things and chain restaurants in the area. You must drive or walk to find ""local"" things. The hotel had a little coffee counter that served some warm breakfast sandwiches at a reasonable price which was nice. The room layout was weird. The doors to the bathroom was barn door style which, when opened, covered up the coffee maker and the fridge. I also banged my foot on the door twice.

So if you ticked up the TV volume and then when the air conditioner stopped the TV volume was way over a comfortable level.I said above in the title this was just about the worst place I have stayed. Second only to a Days Inn somewhere in KS that was downwind from a cattle feedlot. Even that old style noisy air conditioner was better than the Marriott.The front desk would not help and said that the load noise was what was in every room.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,30,"First I will say the hotel is very nice and clean. Great location and a lot of nearby restaurants. Fantastic free breakfast and free champagne to celebrate.We visited on our honeymoon and contacted guest services to inquire about parking. There was a Kings game that evening and traffic was crazy. We had to pull to the side of the road and received many honks while waiting for someone in guest services to advise if parking was available. After ten minutes I was told they offered valet for $48 night. Iasked what was available if we did not want to valet and she said she thought the nearest overnight garage was five miles away. Not walking five miles in LA with suitcases.Next day we requested a late check out and they gave us one.We were interrupted by custodial services with a very loud bang because the door couldn’t be opened. So, someone tried to enter while we were in the room. Scary. I called the front desk and advised someone tried to enter our room with no knocking and we had a late check out.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,20,"Well, I arrived on a Saturday afternoon, after their app said my room was ready. The very small arrival drive up area is understaffed. Finally a guy approaches my car, as I am still on the street, and without identifying himself, upon questioning, seems to be with the hotel. After about 15 minutes or more, I am finally able to pull up on the sidewalk, and they tell me to leave my car there. I get out and attempt to gather my things to go check in. The lobby area, again confusing, signs at places that are not manned, and finally a security guard gets off the phone and points me to the other end of the counter. I get checked into an unnumbered room, with a view of a wall and the roof of an adjacent building.While some of my requested items were in the room, others were not.Later a paper number was attached to the wall, for when I come staggering back drunk later that night. That is the explanation a staff member actually gave me. FYI, not even a glass of wine at dinner that night, and it has been decades that I actually got ""drunk"". Maybe an attempt at humor?The breakfast lounge opened late the next morning, which I expected, as when I had gone out, only one person was working, that I could see, anywhere in the hotel, although there was another person who appeared to be security, busy on his phone.Where am I?

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,20,"First, I'd like to say I love Trip Advisor and the honest reviews, good and bad, posted here. I left a critical review of this hotel on the Marriott/Residence Inn website after receiving an email to do so from the hotel after a recent stay. Funny, my review has not been posted on the Marriott site. That's why I love Trip Advisor. You post the good and the bad reviews.Stayed here for one night en route from PHL to Catalina Island with my family (2 adults, 3 teens). Booked a room in June for a stay in August and specifically booked a 2 bedroom, 2 bath suite. Received confirmation. Booked through the Marriott/ RI website, not a third party site.Arrived at the hotel shortly after check in time. Front desk person took our credit card, checked us in, all seemed fine. Got our keys and went up to the room. It was a studio with 2 queen beds and one bathroom. Hmmm.... No mention of this was made two minutes before when we were at the front desk. I checked my email confirmation from June from Marriott and it specifically said "" two bedroom, two bathroom"". Went down to the front desk. They were, to the best of my knowledge, going to charge us for the two bedroom two bathroom suite but give us a studio? What? And the person checking us in knew he was giving us a room vastly different from the one we booked and was not even going to ... I don't know..... maybe mention it to us? This is weird! When we asked about this we were told:1. The hotel was overbooked. (Bad news if you don't get a room, I guess?)2. They ""regularly"" give the best rooms to the Rewards members leaving everyone else out of luck. (My mistake- husband has a rewards account with marriott but I didn't enter it at the time of reservation, nor did I know that by not including it I would be bumped from my reserved room.)Our two bedroom two bathroom suite was gone. All they could do was give us this weird studio which just would not work for us.So, we asked what they could do for us. They offered a discounted rate for the studio.We did not want it. We asked about connecting rooms and they were able to give us two connecting rooms in the Courtyard (it is connected to the RI) at a lower rate. All this time, the front desk clerk was going ""in the back"" to speak to his manager and coming out with ""offers"" (such as the discounted rate in the studio).We took the connecting rooms. They were fine, but not as nice as suites typically are at Residence Inn. And obviously, there was no kitchen.Some things I think this hotel needs to work on: Customer service and honesty. When someone checks in and you are giving them a room that varies greatly from the one they reserved months before, you need to speak up immediately and make that known. Don't send someone to the room and then hope they don't mind or don't notice. A manager should have come out to speak to us directly during this process. The situation was not escalated or hostile, but some decency on the part of the manager would have gone a long way.We stayed at another Residence Inn in the LA area on our way back to PHL and had the room we booked and had a fantastic experience, so I am not bashing Residence Inn as a whole, just this particular location. We'll continue to stay in Residence Inns, but we won't return to this location.","Mrs. Dustin,Thank you for choosing the Residence Inn Los Angeles L.A. Live.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,30,"My family and I made a return stay at the Residence Inn LA Live in early August. The hotel is very nice and located across the street from the JW Marriott and Ritz Carlton as well as all the offerings of LA Live.Let me start with the major problem. We were there during the Olympics and were, of course, interested in watching as much of them as we could. The hotel has evidently installed a new television system and that was the source of much trouble. Every morning, the sound on the tv could not be heard. The repair crew would come and repair it rather easily, but anytime that the television was turned off the problem would reoccur. It was rather aggravating to have to spend an hour or two waiting for the repair to be made. The hotel staff told me that this was a hotel wide problem and they had not worked the bugs out of the system. In fairness, I will say that I was compensated with 10,000 Marriott points and $50 credit on my account. (Our total bill was right at $2,000).Now to the good! The hotel is new and modern. The room (1908) was clean and well maintained and included a view of the Hollywood Hills and the Hollywood sign. The breakfast area is one of the nicest that I have seen in a RI. Very large and the food was good, although the scrambled eggs were always over done and bacon was not served at most meals. We did not use the 3rd floor rooftop pool, but it is beautiful.I would like to highly commend Alex at the front desk for his smile, desire to help and way in which he welcomes and treats each guest as his personal friend. He is a tremendous asset to this hotel.","Thank you for taking time to share your experiences regarding your recent stay at the Los Angeles LA LIVE Residence Inn.

I do want to point out that the Residence Inn hotel is 219 rooms while the Marriott across the street is quite larger and around 1,000 rooms.

However, due to our longer stay we opted for the convenience of a suite with kitchen. I was pleasantly surprised! The customer services at the valet, front desk and coffee bar in the lobby was on point. The modern design of the hotel was very appealing from the common areas to the room details. The in-room kitchen was great bonus and breakfast buffet expansive.However, I was disappointed to know there was no in-room service option. I also noticed that with the exception of the lobby, valet and the 2nd floor lounge, service staff was non-existing. On one day, while pool side all the towels had been used and there was no one in sight for hours to ask for assistance. I also missed having pool side drinks and food service. Overall, it was a comfortable and decent stay, but we will be defiantly returning to the JW Marriott for their amenities.","Dear love2travel79,Thank you for taking the time to share your experiences regarding your recent stay at the Los Angeles LA LIVE Residence Inn.

The rooms are clean and at least for me (traveling solo for business) were large enough. Couple of negative items of note: when I arrived the valet pulled my suitcase out of the trunk and just handed it to me even though I was already carrying a garment bag and slinging my laptop bag over my shoulder. I thought that was odd and then even once I went to check in, still no bellman was called or offered, so big points off there. I don't expect to have to carry my own luggage when paying north of $300 a night for a room. The room itself as noted above was fine and looked out over Olympic Ave. The bathrooms are okay but nothing to write home about. I was disappointed in the towels as they were well worn and no longer soft so they could definitely use some new linens. Bed was comfortable and I wouldn't hesitate to stay here again but I'll pack light since I have to handle my own luggage.","Dear Outgunned3-1,Thank you for taking time to share your experiences regarding your recent stay at the Los Angeles, LA LIVE Residence Inn.

Here's how our tour of the hotel went:1st room: Tiny room, not as advertised in the picture, bugs, someone's hair pin was on the bed, and within 10 minutes my wife had bites on her legs.2nd room: Slightly less bugs, still tiny room, loud as hell.3rd room: More bugs, still tiny room4th room: I don't know, the front desk person couldn't even open the door5th room: Only 3 bugs, larger but still not as advertised, but didn't have a room key. Sadly this was our best optionThe only reason this place gets 2 stars is because the poor front desk person was willing and friendly enough to show us all of these rooms.I know it's a cheap hotel, I get it. But it doesn't cost any money to vacuum the room and at least pretend it's clean. Also, the way this place is advertised, you would think it was in the middle of LA Live lol. I was wise enough to realize otherwise before I stayed, but I didn't think it would be a 20 minute drive!I don't recommend this place.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,30,"This is the first time i went to LA. since i was with my wife and 2 kids, we wanted a kitchenette and semi service apartment cum hotel. So this seemed the ideal choice.. Ok for first timers, be prepared to pay about 55 to 60 dollars for cab one way. thats the best way to get to the hotel unless you are renting a car from the airport.Be prepared to pay 38 dollars a night for parking. We hired a big cab and our 3 big suitcases fitted in properly(from the airport).dont do the mistake of hiring a shuttle service. they are bad. There was no service for a porter to carry your bag to the room, so we carried it to the room ourselves. The hotel itself is nice but without a proper restaurant apart from the one that serves breakfast. The breakfast was ok , but quite meagre. Even a thing as basic as an omelette was missing(though there were scrambled eggs :)). The staff was quite nice and cooperative. The room was nice with a good and upmarket feel to it. The hotel lobby is mid sized and decent. There was an avis rent a car nearby where we rented a nice ford mustang. You will need a car when in LA. The pool is very nice and is outdoors. The gym is decent for most. The service in the hotel is slightly sparse but was acceptable. The good part was free breakfast for 4 of us and free hi speed internet.There are no good places for a tourist in downtown LA. I thought i would have probably been better off renting a place at Santa Monica. There is nothing close by. Overall its a nice place but with the above caveats.",Thank you so much for staying with us and posting your response. We continue to strive on our service so thanks for pointing that out...I'll be sure to share this review with the team.Erik P - General Manager,Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: August 2014,"Response from erik p, General Manager at Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,10,"From day 1 when I tried to check in it was bad. I got there at 3pm didnt get a room till 11pm the first night. I specifically asked for clean high floor rooms. You would think you can get better service for paying for 2 rooms which were reserved since beginning of July.I get into first room on 16 floor it was a handicap room. Both rooms were dirty there was stains on the bathroom and table counters. Doesnt routine cleaning begin with Windex to spray on counters and vacuum. Why did I wait all day for a handicap dirty room. And the shower is the worst ever in normal room. Its like a plastic board thats flat so water doesnt flow down easliy . There's always a big puddle that accumulates. Very weird shower design. You would never think a modern newly built hotel would have showers like that. First time at Residence Inn. Maybe that's normal but first ever for me. The handicap bathroom was plain dirty red stains on white shower curtains.The air vent is actually on top right in front of one queen bed it was so damn noisy when you open fan in room. So had to sleep with hot room so cold air dont hit you face first and so loud you cant sleep.Wow that's what $249 a night gets you. with$ 38 parking fee with $ 4 parking tax and about 40 bucks a occupancy tax. This isnt first time booking hotel online. Of course the lovely front desk people say its normal. I found it weird. I always get charged what I see online and it wasnt even worth the stay. Every day I felt the rooms& hallways were not cleaned. The pool area had towels and tissues on the floor. the elevator floors were dirty. Both rooms couldnt even be placed on same floor. I spent about 3g for this crappy service. No more Marriott or Residence Inn for me.Breakfast ends at 9am. Get there first day, OJ was never refilled coffee had no warmth. Long lines. One day got there before rest of my party had to argue with man to let my husband in to eat. Because he was coming in at 910 am.The handicap room had to be changed because my niece mysteriously ended up on the other bed with a scratch on her face. Be aware of handicap room on 16 floor. The roomwas 1606. The first front desk lady said no to changing handicap room. I was like I never was told its handicap & I had a bad experience. She flat out said no. I said I m gonna talk to someone else. Wow had help after 3rd lady. Isnt this Residence Inn service great?One of the nights there was a alarm announcement "" after investigation of hotel staff, you may go about your business theres no alarm ....1 am 2-3 times ...Great right?I actually wasted money on 2 rooms at this dump. Never again. The front desk not very helpful nor understanding except the one lady who changed room for me.","Thank you for your recent review that you submitted. We normally do not pre-assign ADA rooms to guests unless they request one ahead of time. During times of high occupancy we place guests in these rooms because it matches their room type request and its the only room we have left in inventory. Thank you for pointing out the pull couch we will have the team check that day. In regards to the overall hotel experience, we had some very high levels of occupancy during your stay with unusally high traffic throughout the elevators, pools and public spaces and we were challenged to keep up.....Again, thank you for your feedback....I can assure you our service levels and delivery are much better....I hope to have you back for another visit.Erik P - General Manager",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: August 2014,"Response from erik p, General Manager at Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,30,"After reading the many positive reviews on this site, we finally settled on this hotel. We were excited about it being new and having a kitchen at our disposal. We were looking forward to our stay. We were traveling with our 2 very small children.As we entered the hotel, we were required to valet the car. This we knew beforehand and since we didn't know the area well, we went ahead and valet the car. It turns out it is about $41 to valet and it includes tax. I highly recommend that you look around. There are other lots (directly in front of the hotel and behind) that allow you in and out privileges and overnight for approx $30.As we try to check in, we are told that our room type is no longer available. After about an hour of trying to figure out how to accommodate us without having to move us in between our stay (I told them either we stay in 1 room or you give us a significant discount if you are going to move me) they were able to put us in a ""recently"" cleaned 2 bed queen (which was our original request)As we get into our room, I check the room to make sure all is okay. Turns out that the room was only partially cleaned. There were dirty towels still in the closet. The kitchen floor was sticky. The toaster had junk stuck to it. The ottoman had food crumbs still on it. I was bewildered as to how can they first have issues getting us a room, and then send us to a dirty room. When I called initially, housekeeping never came, so then I went down to the front desk personally and indicated the issues. They sent housekeeping right away. Karen and Cristal did a wonderful job cleaning up the room. I was so relieved that I kept asking for Karen to clean our room for the rest of our stay. She is a hard worker and knows what she is doing. Its more than I can say of half the people there. Cassie and Kenneth at the front desk in the end gave us some credit for the hassles we had with the room and did take care of us.Unfortunately, our troubles didn't end there. In the morning when getting to breakfast, it was a ridiculously long line (and this was at 8:20 am). A very horribly managed process that needs some serious rework and thought put into it. Its never good when the workers can't keep up because the system itself is so poorly setup. This is a common issue you will find in many of the reviews.And probably the icing on the cake on why we will probably never return here, on our last night, they were drilling and banging so hard on the walls that it woke me up at 12:30 am. When we go out there, Kevin the Director of Service, apologizes and mentions that they are working on a leak. We talked a little bit and he then said for our troubles he would have 2 cups of coffee for us in the morning since we were leaving before breakfast started. It was definitely a pleasant gesture, if he actually remembered. Next morning there was no coffee.In general, its a hotel that looks nice, but cracks are starting to show in their service, cleanliness, and ability to hold their word. Maybe it was a sequence of too many issues that made me upset even over small things, but in general it should never be this difficult of a stay at a hotel. I have found Howard Johnsons more comfortable, clean, and the service attentive than this Marriott property.",I just read your response and I am sorry to hear you had such an unpleasant experience. Occupancy levels were quite high during the course of your stay which caused lines in lounge (everyone seems to come at same time) and harder use of hotel facilities hence the overflowing toilet resulting in the banging and snaking of pipe that awoke you after midnight.I can assure you all these events were a perfect storm and not reflective of our typical service standards or guests experiences.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,30,"After reading the many glowing reviews of this hotel, I was very disappointed in our stay here. Booked 4 nights - 2 adults traveling with 2 teenagers. I booked the 2 queen bed studio with sofa bed so each teen could have their own bed. We arrived at midnight, very tired from a day of travel. Got checked in quickly and headed up to the room. Went to prepare the sofa bed for one of my teens and realized that the bedding for the sofa bed was no where to be found. Called the front desk and they stated that the sofa bed linens are not kept in the room but that housekeeping would need to bring them up - and that would take 30-40 minutes. I offered to come and get the linens but they said they didn't have them at the front desk. Finally, at almost 1 am, a very kind apologetic gentleman came with the linens. I spoke with a manager in the morning that I found this wait time at midnight to be unacceptable - he agreed and said he would address the situation and get back to me. He never did.We were placed in a handicapped accessible room so we did not have the nice new shower stall. We also found out on the second day we were there that our room did not have a microwave oven when we went to heat up some food.The breakfast every morning was a nightmare - crowded, long waits for food. The hotel is in close proximity to a convention center so it seemed as though there were large groups of people coming in at once. I don't even know if they were all Residence Inn guests as one person would have a key to open the door and often 10 people would follow right behind. I give super credit to the people working at the breakfast - they were constantly hustling to refill food and coffee, wipe the tables down, clear tables, etc. All with a smile!On a positive note, the free Wi-Fi was great, the fitness center was very good.I will admit that this Residence Inn is brand new and has all the glitz and glamour of a shiny new property but I think it has a few kinks to work out. We have stayed at other Residence Inns in major cities (Boston, Washington DC) that were also very beautiful properties but had far better service.If in the area again, I think we will stay at the JW Marriott.","I appreciate you taking the time to share your feedback. Yes, there was a large convention in town which sold us out and increased the traffic at breakfast each morning.

Residence Inn by Marriott Los Angeles L.A. LIVE,30,"Seeing that this was a brand new hotel, decided to give it a try. I frequent the jw across the street so I was a bit hesitant to give up the luxuries there. Unlike other residence inns, there is only valet parking at $38 per night. No self parking options but that is to be expected since it is literally right at the staples center. There are public parking nearby that advertise low day prices but that is only for day parking and no overnight parking. Also this residence Inn does not have evening hors d'oeuvres so make sure you have dinner plans. There are also no water bottles in the room. Room is nice and modern. Very quiet and comfortable. Now to find a market.",Thank you very much for your feedback regarding your recent stay to our hotel. You are right...... being in the L.A. LIVE destination we opted to offer valet parking servicesonly but kept are rates competitive with the market and lower than the JW. Being we are footsteps away from 14 amazing restaurants our early feedback was to not offer a social hour as guests would prefer to go explore the area.

Lexen Hotel - North Hollywood,30,"We stayed at this hotel for 3 nights during an 18 day tour around the west coast of the USA. This resulted in quite a few hotel experiences, some good, some not so.Staff : I would describe the reception staff at The Lexen as 'bored'. Often they were not at the desk and when traced were more often than not on their phones, either talking or typing. On arrival I asked for local info and received a very disinterested response so didn't try again. The cleaning staff do not speak any English so I would advise against asking them anything (not a criticism).The hotel is small as described. There are 4 floors. All rooms appear to look onto the central courtyard where the bar is located. The bar is hardly used (can it be justified?) however as it is open from 5pm until 11pm each night and as a result the music, which is played loudly, can be heard from your room. As can the glass bottles being cleared after the bar closed. I did ask if there was another room but told abruptly no (I got the impression this is a common question). The music from the bar being audible in your room when you want to sleep is the one and only reason I world not recommend this hotel. Why, if the bar is empty, can the music not be quieter? In fact, as it is a social area rather than a pub environment, why do all the room occupants have to listen to this every night (some of whom also have children). I can accept in some hotels outside noise is an issue, but can't really accept noise generated by the hotel design itself.The rooms : the room itself was absolutely fine. Two queen beds, comfortable. Good shower and bath. Safe, small fridge, iron and hairdryer. There is also a small coffee machine in bathroom.Breafast: there is a small breakfast room which each day did not have enough seats for the guests...and the max I saw there any morning was about 20. There are options of bananas, apples, porridge pots, bread and bagels and muffins. The is a coffee machine (available 24/7) which does cappuccino, latte, Americano etc nice touch). However, this is the only hot drink option at breakfast time so a queue develops (including housekeeping staff?) and the machine has to do a reheat cycle every so often which takes about 5 mins. Suggest some black coffee available separately for those who do not want a speciality coffee may help with queue. The coffee machine is located next to the only toaster in the corner of this room. As a result, this area is busy even with 5 people and is not really fit for purpose for a hotel with 40 rooms. Not much else I can say about breakfast, filled a gap.Gym:there is an air conditioned gym with 2 x treadmills, an elliptical trainer, a recumbent bike, a functional trainer, some very dirty yoga mats and a gym ball. There is a water machine and hand sanitiser but nothing to clean the equipment after use?? Suggest some sanitiser spray and wipes.Garage:as mentioned $10 dollars a night.Deposit :$250... Only hotel we stayed in that took such a large amount. Yet to see how long it takes to get it back.Location : North Hollywood (NoHo) seems a nice neighbourhood. There is a park across the road which is good if you jog (about 0.9 mile lap). There are homeless people in the park but we soon realised that is unfortunately the same all over the city. They gave me no hassle when I ran there. There is a 7-11 round the corner and plenty of places to eat. A lot are counter service. I would hight recommend Daves Hot Chicken on Lankershim - queues out the door says it all.The red line metro is nearby and will take you downtown. We took the metro to Hollywood Boulevard and also to Universal. ($1.75 single trip of $7 day pass) $2 to buy a TAP then load it at the station.To conclude my many thoughts on this hotel. It seems to me alot of thought went into the actual room design and theme of the hotel, but the practicality of the bar location being adjacent to rooms and the breakfast room let's it down, not to mention the general feeling the staff couldn't care less.As I type this I can hear the bar music and know I will not be sad to see when I leave this hotel.I had high hopes for the Lexen from the reviews (some of which I think are frauds looking at the one off reviews and user names), however it was a disappointment for me personally.","Thank you for taking the time to go into so much detail regarding your stay here; we are pleased that you had an enjoyable time, and the details that you have provided should be of great assistance to others thinking of visiting this area.

Lexen Hotel - North Hollywood,30,We found the location to be close to quite a few attractions in the Hollywood Hills area. Easy and cheap commute be a Uber or Lyft. Room was okay. Air conditioning certainly annoying at night and seem to blow right into your face. Breakfast was not very good selection and opted to eat out every morning. Parking is definitely a problem in the evening unless you park on the street the hotel has a very limited parking spaces available and if it's full they expect the keys because you will have to park in front of another vehicle. Seemed also a little noisy in the evening coming from the courtyard as the bar is open late. Value to comfort was adequate. Probably would return if in the area again.,"Many thanks for your kind review posted recently and for taking the time to share your experience with us.

Lexen Hotel - North Hollywood,30,"This is a very nice, fairly new, hotel. The rooms are spotlessly clean and very nicely furnished. The bed is really comfortable with lovely bedding. The bathroom was very clean with lovely fluffy white towels.Now for the downsides. Constant noise from outside as the windows are not sufficiently soundproofed. The hotel’s location does not provide much in the way of restaurants. The breakfast provided is minimal - toast, bagels, porridge cups, yoghurt and juice. There is no coffee maker in the room, but a machine is available in the breakfast room off the lobby.

Lexen Hotel - North Hollywood,10,"Let me start by stating that this review is for the management and their policies, not the hotel itself. I was going to be passing through L.A. and booked one room for one night at the Lexen through Expedia. Unfortunately for me, I used the autofill to enter my info and ended up making a reservation for the day before I arrived. I noticed the error that same night and tried to change my reservation but they were completely booked for the night I was going to be in town. I called the Lexen directly but was unable to get a hold of someone. Expedia called on my behalf but they said the front desk staff said the issue would have to wait until the following morning when the manager arrived. When I arrived in L.A., (I ended up staying at the BLVD and highly recommend it!) I took the time to go personally to the Lexen but the front desk employee told me the same thing: it was a matter for a manager but she was not on the premises, so they asked me to return hours later. Long story short, I was never able to talk to a manager until days later over the phone (I had already left L.A.) and after my many attempts at talking to an administrator, I was told the policy of the hotel was simply NO refunds. I understand it was my mistake and the policy is clear on their website. My review has the purpose of warning those who are considering booking at this hotel in the future: THEIR BOTTOM LINE IS MORE IMPORTANT THAN YOUR SATISFACTION. Despite the fact that the hotel doesn't seem to be wanting for business (they were completely booked), they had no interest in making any service recovery efforts, even for an honest mistake. I have dealt with businesses before where they happily refund money for services that were not provided, even if they have a policy of no refunds because they acknowledge that everyone makes mistakes and more importantly, they understand that in the service/hospitality industry customer retention through service recovery is essential. The management at Lexen was more interested in keeping my money, even one room for one night's worth, than in establishing a good reputation.","Sol,Thank you for taking the time to leave a review.I apologize for the inconvenience and I understand your frustration. Unfortunately, we have certain policies set in place that we are required to uphold, including our strict 24-hour cancellation policy.We cannot adjust our policy for just one guest, while expecting to deliver the same, exceptional service to our other guests.

They were rude and condescending. Exact words from Russ were “your paying 25.00 for parking at universal studios why won’t you pay that here!?” At that point it was principal. It was a horrible experience. The manager did absolutely nothing to help, he actually made it much worse!! We asked for the owners contact info and he refused to give that to us. BEWARE OF HIDDEN CHARGES & horrible customer service. We ended up staying elsewhere that was cheaper and had amazing customer service!!! Just beware of this place. Don’t stay here!!!","Hi thank you for taking the time to leave such a strongly worded review.I’d like to apologize for any inconvenience you experienced during your stay with us. We do advertise as requiring a deposit and $10 nightly parking fee at check in on all our platforms, so you may have booked from a faulty 3rd party that we do not do business with. This kind of thing occasionally happens in the hospitality industry so it is very important for all potential guests to check that you are booking from a verified Online Travel Agency.Our employees are required to follow our policies, so there is not much that can be done to waive parking fees or anything similar. This kind of decision is not up to to the front desk staff.Regardless, we do appreciate your business, and hope to have another opportunity to serve you and your family again in the future.",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: July 2018,"Response from LexenHotelNoHo, General Manager at Lexen Hotel - North Hollywood","Responded Aug 2, 2018"

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,30,"This hotel was in a nice area, can walk to many restaurants, grocery stores, coffee shops and the Marina. We were here during COVID as healthcare providers so this review can be taken with a grain of salt as everything in the hotel was closed. The rooms were not very clean as well as the property itself. It seems like they were operating on a limited staff as we saw the same individuals daily. There was trash all by the outside area and leaves, dirt and dust. It looked like nothing had been cleaned in months which truly should have been the opposite. The balcony's outside the room were very dirty as well which was very disappointing. Truly grateful that we had somewhere to quarantine but if the hotel wasn't properly clean or sanitized it really doesn't matter. I ended up bringing my own cleaners and cleaned myself. Would it be different if they had full staff..maybe, but they do need to make some upgrades since they are the hilton it should be higher quality than what was provided. There was a coffee maker and small fridge in every room which was helpful and we were able to obtain clean towels daily if needed.","Dear blesdx4,Thanks for taking the time to provide your feedback.

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,20,"We booked this room because descriptions said it was recently renovated. The outdoor areas most likely have been renovated, but our room, sadly was not. Usually I am very cautious to complain but our room was really disappointing. The carpeting is very old and has multiple stains. The pull out sofa was in pretty rough shape - old and dirty. The worst part was probably the never-ending sound of the elevator going up and down even in the middle of the night.The other downside of our room as it was very dark. The overall size was excellent, but it just felt dirty. We paid almost the same nightly rate at the Beverly Hilton. That was a much better experience.On the positive side, the check in was speedy and she was very courteous. Breakfast was decent and the service was excellent.

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,10,"We stayed at the MDR in the beginning of May. The hotel was clean and freshly remodeled. The room was non descript, nothing good, nothing bad about it. The bartender at the restaurant was excellent. My issues are with the fact that my daughter lost her tablet in the bed. I knew almost right away so I called. I was passed around on the phone a few times, the front desk person was less than pleasant and I kept getting hung up on. I finally was connected with housekeeping after calling back 3 times, only to get a voicemail. I was never called back. I called a few days later, same thing, even after explaining my inability to get in touch with someone and not getting a return call all the front desk would do was transfer me again. So I called the next day. I got a lady on the phone who was far more helpful and took my information. She said she would pass it along. Unfortunately that went unreturned as well. I finally got a hotel manager who had the housekeeping person get in touch with me. I explained that I was back in the area and would really like to pick it up before 1 so I could have it on the plane. He found the item but called me at 1:30, as I was returning my rental. So now they have to mail it to me to the tune of $50. Had it not taken 5 days to get in touch with someone (after some serious follow up) I wouldn't have had to pay $50. Since my attempt to call and rectify a situation was terrible, I emailed about being charged an extra day of parking. That email has also never been returned. So I'm out $80 unnecessarily. There are loads of other hotel options in LA, I'd consider alternatives.","Dear Ramanda26,Thank you for your feedback in regards to your most recent stay at Hotel MdR.

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,20,"Had stayed at the hotel a few times a few years back and, as we had family business in the area decided to give it another try. As Hilton Gold Members, we always had a decent to good experience at this place.We arrived around 6 pm and were greeted at the check in as expected. She offered cookies and the complementary water and asked which of the two left rooms we wanted. I seemed the hotel was full and only two rooms were available. One close to the elevator, one more in the middle. We opted for the room away from the elevator traffic overlooking a parking lot but she told us that the hotel would have more rooms available the next day and we could move to a more convenient. We took it.Entering the room, we realized this room hadn’t been used for a while, it smelled musky and as we found out, it was one of the few rooms in the hotel without balcony or bigger window. Also, immediately we saw a big clump of hair (dog ? ) right beside the garbage can. Seemed house keeping vacuumed but didn’t pick things up.As we were tired and the hotel was full, we decided to sleep and then hopefully move rooms the next day.Room was warm and we quickly realized air conditioning didn’t work. Yes, you could turn on heat, but not cool it down. Odd.Next day I told house keeping about the broken AC and she told me that she would have maintenance look into it. Nothing happened.We had family events to go and in the evening, coming back to the hotel I asked if there was a different room available. We were told they would look into it and let us know the next morning. So another night in a warm room.Next morning same thing, telling Housekeeping about AC and promise to “look into it”. Same with room change. Nothing.Room otherwise was ok, Bed comfortable, but bathroom needed updating (rust on the lights, mirrors etc). It seemed this room was a last resort type room when hotel was full. I understand, but why not move guests when other rooms are available.While the room was normally quiet, in the morning, starting before 6 am, truck traffic in the parking lot and at the next door business woke you up (beeping of trucks, reving of engines etc). The other rooms we had stayed in before overlooked the front side or the court yard and were much quieter.When we checked out after a few days (not having been able to get a different room even though the hotel was clearly not fully occupied), no one even asked if we enjoyed the stay or anything. Just a business transaction.Hotel also charges a 26 Dollar (plus $2.60 Parking tax) Parking fee….imho it’s Highway Robbery.Only saving grace was the very friendly, cheerful and helpful staff in the restaurant during breakfast.","Dear gcto20,I appreciate you informing me about your recent stay.

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,20,"Booked the two-room king suite because we have a toddler, and we need to be able to put him down for naps and early bedtimes. The room was nice and large, but that is the extent of my praise. The oddly-shaped oversized room had just a small smattering of gross, saggy, worn-out furniture, giving it the appearance of a party room where who-knows-what may have gone down. The funky smell didn't help any. The curtains didn't close all the way, and they had holes in them anyways. The bathroom looked like it had last been remodeled in the late 80s. The air conditioning had two levels: defeaningly loud and off. There was also a strange tone that rang out several times an hour. It sounded like a boat horn, and that's what we initially thought it was, until it kept happening over and over. The satellite TV didn't work, and neither did the elevator call buttons. Our room key was supposed to get us in and out of the parking lot, but that didn't work either. I honestly can't remember all the of things that made this stay so miserable, as it's been several days, but I can't remember the last time I paid so much for such a disappointing hotel stay.

I normally carry a universal plug that I take on my international trips ( it also has a place to plug a usb cable) but considering it was a US trip I did not bring it along.

There were dark colored stains on the walls and blinds, and also on our bed sheets! The stains on our bed sheets looked like old blood stains and make up concealer? There was also hair on the inside of our sheets. (we informed front desk and they switched us to another room).-Our second room had a better view of the pool, but unfortunately, our bed sheets were still visibly dirty, with again what seemed to be blood stains and make up/dirt stains. I'm not sure if this is a common problem, or if we were just really unlucky. (We were so tired from our day, that we just threw towels on top of the sheets to sleep on and informed front desk the next morning). They immediately replaced all of our bedding the next morning.-The rooms are a bit old and outdated, and it shows-Our bathtub had a slow drain, which was a bit annoying-The toilet sometimes didn't flush all the way-The heater in our room didn't work-Although this is a smoke-free facility, a couple times when our son had opened the balcony door to check the weather (it had been raining), our room would be engulfed in a strong marijuana odor.-We had ordered room service for breakfast and our french toast was runny/uncooked in the middle, and the fruit in our fruit/yogurt platter was sitting in a layer of water on top of our yogurt. We didn't eat much of that breakfast. It definitely wasn't worth $64 for a bad breakfast.-The mat in the bathtub had previous guests hairs all over it.I had already made a complaint about the bed sheets twice and didn't want to be that annoying guest that just kept complaining, so I left my concerns as is.

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,30,"I travel to the Marina del Rey/Playa Vista area 5-6 times per year for work and have really fallen for this often-overlooked corner of Los Angeles. MdR is clean, less congested, and far more residential than its ""cooler"" neighbors Venice and Santa Monica to the north.The Hotel MdR is wedged in-between a new multi-use mid-rise apartment/retail complex named Stella and a shopping plaza that has a higher-end Pavilions grocery store. Across the street is an even higher-end outdoor mall that includes restaurant concepts like Yardhouse, Ruth's Chris, and Tendergreens (a personal fav!)Upon checking-in, I was impressed at the hotel renovation of this five-story property, with a view straight into the outdoor pool area. It was modern and clearly recently renovated.My King guest room (#501) faced the front of the property and was a very good size. It was interesting, though, because for being a Hilton/Doubletree-badged hotel, the actual furnishings were that of a Courtyard Marriott, complete with the red/beige-striped carpeting that was standard across the franchise during its mid-aughts phase. I haven't gone back to look, but I'm assuming that location changed its brand association, but didn't invest in new room furnishings or carpet upon becoming Hotel MdR... which is where I thought it really missed the mark.Clearly, nothing in the room, short of one wall being painted a pleasant blue color, has been visibly updated in quite some time. To be fair, everything was clean and in working order, but simply dated-looking in its style. For instance, the HDTV was one of those bulky, 32"" models that sits on a countertop versus being larger and wall-mounted. The vanity in the bathroom was clearly the exact same one that Courtyard has in hundreds of its brand properties. Even small details, like the directional room number signage was torn from the elevator lobby wall on the fifth floor -- with its adhesive still all over the wallpaper.That said, the bedding package appeared to be one of the nicer Hilton ones (actually a notch-above the typical Doubletree linens) and the free Hhonors WiFi was decent in its speed, with 12-16mbp/s. For folks who use videoconferencing like Zoom, be aware that my connection, while more than fast enough up and down, struggled with latency issues. This resulted in using my trusty Verizon 4G hotspot instead.Hopefully, the newer-looking lobby design will eventually make its way up to the rooms. If so, this will make the Hotel MdR one of the better properties in the area -- especially for people who want to avoid the larger, conference-driven hotels like the Marriott and Ritz-Carlton nearby.","Dear number_fourty,Thank you for the very detailed and positive review.

I was charged at random day 700$ when asked they mentioned it was a mistake!!!!!!!!!3) the first day on arrival I was giving a free yellow pass car parking spot. Ten days later I was called and asked to pay 30$ a day for car parking spot. Which again apologized and said it’s a mistake!!!!!!!!!I never taken pictures for memories because I don’t want to remember this place again.I strongly advise anyone staying at this hotel to double check on your credit card on daily basis.","Thank you for taking the time to leave us a review of your experience, we are terribly sorry that we fell short on your expectations.

Here’s the good: great location within walking distance to shops, restaurants, grocery stores, Barnes & Noble, movie theaters and more. The hotel staff was pleasant. Comfortable bed.The bad: nearly $200 was tacked on to my overall room charge for taxes and service fees (service for what)? The bathtub was gross looking. Broken tiles (patched) above the tub.The ugly: I had read online that the hotel had been renovated and was described as “hip and trendy”. I was shocked to find that really meant cold and stark looking. You walk in to a lobby that features acres of grayish tile and a charcoal gray couch at the far end (with a hole in the left armrest, by the way), a coffee table with some sort of low plant arrangement, two chairs with a drum table between. A lamp over the couch. Not a cozy arrangement, not inviting. Nothing to soften this stark lobby. My room featured two charcoal gray walls to contrast with golden yellow walls. There was a large photo of something undetermined, also shades of gray, on one of the charcoal walls. The only chair was an office chair to go with the desk. So much for “hip and trendy”... It’s ugly.","Dear Georgie2020,Thank you for sharing your thoughts about your stay at Hotel MdR. I am glad you found the hotel conveniently located and a pleasant staff with a comfortable bed.

Beds are comfy, but my friend did find his sheets with dried blood all over them, so that's a thing as well. What really got me is that while staying here, I had my room broken into while I was at work for the day. They stole several items from me, including my PS4. Management was very unhelpful in the process, and did not follow their own procedures for this kind of event. Even after several days, there has been no resolution or offer of compensation for this.A few days later, I stayed at a new room in this hotel (nonrefundable), and discovered a broken shower in my room.If you can stay elsewhere, do so.

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,10,"There's no good, just bad and ugly. Arrived last night around 11pm. I'm a Hilton Honors member and my room had been reserved by my corporate travel agent. Somehow, the front desk clerk couldn't find it, or was just confused. After about 10 minutes waiting for him to figure it out, he finally gave me keys to my room. Great! Except, I get all the way up to the room to find out - the keys don't work. Back down to the front desk and the clerk says there must be something wrong with the reservation and cancels and rebooks the whole thing. Another 10 minutes. Great! Except, I get up to my room and it smells. Okay, I can live with that - I'm exhausted. I set my thermostat for 67 degrees and crash hard. At 1 AM, I wake up sweating and hot. The thermostat has somehow switched itself from A/C to heat and the fan is pumping hot air and the room is 77 degrees. Cue the call to the front desk - they say they'll send somebody up. The overnight person doesn't have a clue, but I've fiddled with the thermostat in the meantime and cool air is flowing. I try to go back to sleep - but, an hour later (2am at this point), the fan starts blowing hot air again. I call back the front desk and switch rooms. Another smelly room. But, at this point, I just hope that the A/C works - miraculously, it does. But, I had to find another hotel because I'm not staying here another night. This hotel makes me wonder whether I should stay with Hilton. This is not up to snuff for the brand.","Thank you for taking the time to provide us with your valuable feedback.

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,30,"Stayed one night here because it was somewhat close to Venice beach. Let me start with the good things. The main lobby and dining/bar area (all on the main level) were new and modern looking. The breakfast in the morning was surprisingly well done. The staff we encountered were friendly enough.Ok, now the rest. The pool, yes they had cabanas, from afar they looked nice. However, when we got into one, they were really dirty. There were blackish dirt stains all over the cushions and everything was soaking wet. They had plenty of lounge chairs around the pool but once again the cushions were wet and dirty. In order to use them, you would have had to throw the cushions on the ground and lay on the wood. The lack of care and upkeep around this pool was unfortunate because the design and layout of the pool area was kind of cool. The rooms had balcony’s which was cool. However our looked out over a trash can area and all of the bins that held the laundry, so no point in sitting out there. The room level (we were on the 2nd floor) was older looking than the main level, like they haven’t remodeled it yet. Same with the rooms. The one we had was not remodeled. The beds were somewhat comfortable. The elevator was sketchy, very old, very slow and very noisy. Parking was ok, I believe it cost $21 a night but not 100% sure on that. But it was close to the entrance.","Dear chrisaE4425XW,Thank you for providing us with your feedback about your recent stay at Hotel MdR.

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,10,"My reservation was cancelled without any notices. I didn't received a cancellation email or even receive a courtesy phone call from the hotel on why they cancelled my reservation. The only reason I found out my reservation was cancelled because I have a habit of double checking my reservation a few days before my Arrival date. My reservation no where to be found under ""Upcoming"" in my Hilton app. I clicked on ""Cancelled"" and there it was. Cancelled. It was good thing I double check the status of my reservation or I would have arrive at the hotel with no reservation. I thought maybe someone from the hotel cancel my reservation on accident. So I called the hotel to find out. Jasmine picked up the phone. She greeted herself and she said, ""please hold"" and she placed straight to hold without waiting for my response. I waited over 10 minute to speak to someone, but they kept placing me on hold when the Hold function time out each time. A couple minutes later, they hung up on me. I thought maybe they accidentally hung up while they were trying to place me on hold for a fourth time. So I called again, but they placed me straight to hold without any greeting this time. After this encounter, I decided I'm not going to wait any longer. If this is how they treat their customer, then I'm glad they cancelled my reservation. Truth be told, this doesn't meet to Hilton standard. If I was happen to be the Hilton Quality Assurance Auditor, then they would have received a lower score based on the experiences I had.

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,10,"To give a background, we had called the hotel to book a room after being evacuated from the wildfires. I had specifically requested a king pool view room to the lady on the reservation line, which I was told was still available. Received confirmation email, we were put in a double room. Called back, was told that she would book it. Received confirmation email, room was still wrong. Called back again, was told to talk to front desk. So we arrived and spoke to front desk and were put in a highway facing room, so we requested to move. Moved to a room next to the elevator, which we didn't figure would be too noisy minus people coming and going but the elevator would get so loud you couldn't sleep. Went downstairs again to request to move rooms, gentleman at the front desk said he would have it taken care of for the next day. Next morning, went downstairs to check on our room and spoke to the lady at the front desk - nothing was done, even though the gentleman said he would take care of. She booked us into a room for when we returned from the NFL game, which was finally the room we had requested. I don't want to sound unappreciative at all, because my husband and I are so grateful that we were able to book a room with everything going on. HOWEVER, we were told that the room we wanted was available numerous times and numerous times it was screwed up. The front end staff was so indifferent and couldn't be bothered. It's unfortunate because we stay at Doubletree's quite a bit and this is the first time we've encountered so many issues.

Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,30,"Stayed here recently while travelling through California. Hotel Staff were very welcoming and the room was spacious, clean and tidy. We used the pool and it was a lovely area. The bar staff were also very friendly. The hotel is in a good location, very busy with traffic but what area of LA isn't! Our room had a balcony but it looked directly onto a concrete wall, probably about 10 feet in front of it. Not the greatest of views, we would have been as well in a standard room as I wouldn't have classed our room as having a pool view. The other thing that was disappointing was the dirty wine glasses with medication in one of them and the broken glass that was outside our room door on arrival at 4pm. As it was still there at 7pm we contacted reception as we didn't want to be getting the blame. When we went out the room a short time later to take a stained towel back for change, we noticed that the broken glass had been removed but not the other two which had someones medication tablet in it. As we had young children we took the glasses back down to the desk. The girl was very apologetic and knew it was us who had already phoned about this. We got fresh towels delivered and she promised to speak to the Manager and would get some Hilton Points added on for our inconvenience. We were satisfied with this as these things can happen. Having checked my statement I notice I haven't had any extra points added yet - I hope they are true to their word as we have used Hilton a lot this year in the UK and USA and this has been the only stay where we have left slightly disappointed.","Dear Barry D,Thank you for sharing your feedback with us about your recent stay. First of all, I do apologize for the wine glasses that you encountered during your arrival. I will be sure to speak with my management team about this as to avoid this in the future for any guests. I defeintelyt want to ensure that we made it right for you so if you would not mind emailing or cantacting me directly at the hotel so I can assure your points were credited to your account. this process can take a few weeks but I want to ensure it was initiated.Sincerely,Steve P",Trip type: Traveled with family,Date of stay: October 2018,"Response from Steve P, General Manager at Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel","Responded Oct 30, 2018"
Hotel MdR-A DoubleTree by Hilton Hotel,30,So I have stayed at this hotel at least 3 times before and had no negative issues. This time though there was a lot of noise inside and out. The hotel seems not to have any onsite security or if they due it is clearly lacking. There was an drunk person yelling in the halls trying to enter guests rooms for over 20 minutes before the police were called. Additionally the parking lot was not patrolled since there was a lot of nose around 2-3am and nothing was being done to control the issue. When I confronted the front desk at checkout it was just oh ya sorry. The hotel is directly across from a nice bunch of stores and movie theater. It is a good location and a reasonable price but unless they improve security procedures I am unable to recommend!,"Dear Ken A,Thank you for being a loyal customer for Hotel MdR. I am sorry you experienced the security issues that you did during your last stay. I can assure you that this was a one time situation and group that caused those problems you experienced.

Elan Hotel,20,"I’ve been coming back to this hotel a few times a year for 5 years and it was GREAT on all levels until recently. Staff are always nice and professional BUT it’s changed ownership yet again and now the parking fee has jumped to $40 day, Cedars Rate keeps climbing up, the vibe is no longer warm with the current decor, the tables and chairs in lobby dining area are now so jammed together that I had to assist another guest to navigate around them to get to a seat while carrying his breakfast, plus on my last visit my room had a desk chair in with a shabby looking, worn out seat.

I had then asked to pay for my valet, the women was extremely rude and not responsive. When I was trying to relax and work on a project, they had complimentary wine and cheese. A women was following me the whole time well I was making my plate. When I had left the hotel to get dinner, valet left another persons keys in my car.

Elan Hotel,30,"Free parking, what free parking:I want up to Elan for overnight business trip and arrived in the evening.The first thing is that when you search for “free parking” under booking.com. Do not believe it.Elan has a $35/night fee. They did showed me that it is under the parking notes on booking.com. Sneaky booking.com!!! So I paid, but we warned!How about some fresh air people:The second thing is it’s an older property with one big problem if you have allergies. Very poor air circulation. The older buildings do not exchange the lobby and hallway air at all. Just not something done in the 50’s. So that’s why the hotel smell “musty”. The hotel we would be well served to open a few doors for a few hours a day.The second problem is that the bathroom has an air-exchange vent but it does not work so no air exchange in the room. So the room really played havoc with me since like the hallways the room was musty which is mold. Not visible, but it there trust me.I know my next door neighbors business:So the room is small with only one chair for the desk. I was sitting on the bed and my next door neighbor was on his. More on that, So the poor guy was talking on his cellphone and I could clearly hear what he was saying. He was not talks loud, just to his girlfriend. So to get some sleep out-come the earplugs.

Elan Hotel,30,"2 night business trip-Checks in ...no place to put the car to valet painted red curb on the Valet street. For 195.00 the room is like a dorm a tiny tiny room with a double bed. Not no view and the shower head is th best part of th room. Wine and cheese nice touch with bad wine. When I checked in I asked for a upgrade since I am a Stash memeber and they said they didn’t have one but please they did and didn’t bother because I was argued with about getting a Another room with the manager.They have no resturant no bar and No Gym so if you want these things would not reccimend this property. I have stayed at their sister properties and they have restaurants a bar and gym. They have a continental cold breakfast wine and cubes cheese happy hour. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everyone. They say they upgraded but you notice the carpets are filthy and in the lobby it’s hot they don’t seem to turn the A/C on so when you step into the hotel it’s like being outside. Note if you valet your car you won’t know where to stop since it’s parkled red on beverly Blvd for 30.00 a night extra.Def for the price you can stay at the Hilton or Hyatt or andaz and have bigger room and more amenities.Overpriced boutique Stash hotel. Thin walls!! Tiny tiny rooms, double beds:( dirty carpets, only perk is the location is good for work since centrally located in West Hollywood. Bad Valet parking location. No views can’t open your curtains -more like a upgraded Motel.","Dear Wendy W,Thank you for taking to time to share your review with our fellow travelers. We are very sorry that we were not able to accommodate your demand for an upgrade upon your arrival; we are more than happy to provide upgrades to our guests when availability permits. Unfortunately, the hotel was completely committed on the day you arrived, and we did not have any upgrades to offer for that night. Our guest services associate attempted to explain that the hotel was completely sold out for your first night. As a courtesy, I did offer to provide an upgrade the next day when availability permitted. However, you stated that you did not want to move, as your request was for the day of arrival. The Elan does not advertise restaurants or bars on premises. I am sorry that you missed these details when making your reservation. We do try our best to make sure all of our guests are aware of the very many dining options within walking distance of the hotel. I am sorry that you did not enjoy our continental breakfast nor our wine and cheese reception. These amenities are added value for all of our guests and we do our best to provide the highest level of quality for each. Thank you for mentioning our location, as the hotel does offer a great location! As parking in the City of LA can often be troublesome, we offer valet services with in and out privileges 24 hours a day for our guest convenience. Please, When making your next reservation, may I ask you to please give us advance notice so that we can accommodate your demand for upgrades?

Elan Hotel,30,"We have stayed at the Elan in the past, but the last time was about 5 years ago. It was a nice hotel and and in the general area we wanted to be in. It also was not an overly expensive hotel for LA, but did need renovation.This last time we found they have redone the lobby and made it very nice. The wine and appetizers they serve in the afternoon makes it appealing. However, we thought that when they renovated the lobby they had redone the entire hotel. The rooms are very tired, the carpet was very dirty and everything looks dated. The bathroom wall paint is peeling is several areas. They really need new mattresses and I had a backache each morning when I woke while I was there.The staff is very pleasant and helpful. I would not go back until they have renovated.","Dear Gail F,We appreciate your return visit to the Elan Hotel.

Elan Hotel,30,"We (hubby and I) stayed at the Elan hotel for 4 nights at the end of May 2018. The hotel was convenient for the hop on hop off bus, Beverley shopping centre and also The Grove shopping centre and Farmers Market was a short (about 2km) walk away. After sitting on a plane from Australia for a million hours - the walk to The Grove was just what we needed.The farmers market had fresh fruit and supplies.The hotel itself was small and the rooms not overly sound proof. There wasn't much room inside the room - which was OK given we were out sight seeing each day, but each night the only place to sit was on the bed. The lobby did have some chairs you could sit on if you wanted some more space.The breakfast was a bit disappointing and we chose to skip this most days which was a shame as it was included.Overall it was OK but if we were staying longer I would look for somewhere else to stay just with a bit more room and a bit less noisy.","Dear Stacey P,Thank you for giving the Elan Hotel the opportunity to serve you.

Elan Hotel,20,"We arrived to a hallway filled with plywood lined hallways and checked in in the temporary office in a room. No one had made us aware of the hotel being under construction and certainly no adjustment to rates. No one at the hotel except for the valet acknowledged the mess the hotel is currently under! Luckily our stay was just two days so we pushed through it as we had already made plans shortly after our check in. On our way out the first evening, we were lucky to make sure the door closed as it didn’t lock properly and would only secure if you jiggled the handle a bit. The walls are paper thin and you can hear everything going on around you in the hallway and adjacent rooms. The only reason I gave two stars is that the room was at least clean, but two stars is a stretch. Upon checkout, the elevator was out of order and we had to drag bags down the hallway only to find out the main entrance was closed and we had to pickup our vehicle from the valet in the back alley....","Dear Taylor R,I want to personally thank you for your business and offer my sincere apologies for any inconvenience that you might have had during the hotel rejuvenation stage.

Elan Hotel,20,"Loved the hotel itself, lobby and very nice comfortable room furnishings. Modern lobby & nearby intimate lounge area, great expanded continental breakfast. All was generally good there except for one major issue. About 9 pm the water in our bathrooom would not come out when turned on...in shower, toilet and sink. The toilet was obviously especially a problem. A call to the front desk was met with no apology just that for some reason the property’s water supply had been cut off due to a possible unexpected city or nearby block project, manager was not sure, said they were looking into it. So the entire hotel had no water which means we could not very easily get ready for bed or flush the toilet. Nor could all other guests I presume. Very strange, and no info from staff on when water would return. We went to bed around 1 am and by about 5 am it seemed water was back on. In mentioning this again to front desk upon checking out I was told an entirely different story. He said their hot water heater was scheduled to be replaced on that Monday night and so water had to be shut off only in the hotel and this was the best time. What??? So it was not a city or block-wide problem but exclusive to the hotel. I kind of expected some sort of compensation consideration for this very odd and annoying inconvenience, at least a little discount on the night or future stay credit. Again, not much of an apology or anything similar. How they can just expect guests to tolerate this with no advance notice or clarity of explanation or compensation is beyond me, especially given the $170 rate AND unreasonable $30 overnight parking fee! This kind of thing might not be surprising at a much much cheaper motel on a highway somewhere but not at an upscale city property charging what they do, which clearly markets to business travelers. I asked if they could wave the charge for the 2 in-room bottles of water that would have cost $9, which we had to use between 9 pm and the morning. They agreed to this as part of a very civil and easy conversation at checkout. The appropriate approach would be to notify guests upon booking or check-in of this situation AND offer either a discount or easy cancellation at that moment, or offer a discount after the fact. Therefore, I give this place 2 stars rather than 4 or 5. I feel like this is fair given their bizarre and unfortunate planning, misleading communication and insensitive expectations and responses.","Dear David H,Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with our fellow Tripadvisors, please accept our most sincere apologies for any inconveniences that you experienced while staying at the Elan hotel.

My fiance drove us, so we had to get the car parked by valet,which is not an issue in and of itself, but it was a rainy night when we wanted to go out, and it took us forever to find the valet guy, because he wasn't in his proper place, and then once we found him, it took him forever to bring us the car, and was really not nice to us. It's a 2008 Mitsubishi, but if we are paying for valet, and for a room, we should be treated decently, at least. And I had paid for extras, too. The bed was comfortable, and I slept well, but I would not come back here, based on what happened this one time.

Ended up using Postmate to get something delivered.Bedding is fine. No views. Mattresses are comfortable. Very clean. Welcoming staff. They did go out of their way to find me an HD cable.. they had a thing to attach to the tv via different connections, but I didn't have an HD wire with me, so I couldn't use it to watch movies off my lap top without that.So in short - good location, but not enough frills for 269.00 a night, which is what I paid.

Elan Hotel,30,"Our stay didn't get off to the best of starts when after a long flight and taxi ride we struggled into reception with our luggage and I gave my name to be greeted with a response along the lines of ""And? Do you have a reservation?"" in such a snooty manner. Really? Why else would I be offering my name?After that almost everything was okay, but really, just okay. The room was fine with plenty of storage and a small balcony, though no furniture for the balcony. The breakfasts were a bonus with enough choice to satisfy us both whilst the evening wine reception went down well.At the other hotels we stayed in during our US trip there was water available in reception 24 hours a day which was the same here on our first full day. On the second day we noticed it had gone and when my wife queried this at reception the same chap as our first encounter dismissively told her ""it starts at 5"" and went about his business. He, however, was referring to the wine reception which she wasn't even asking about. Maybe this was the same male member of staff referred to in the review of 7 Sep 2016. After this we just kept ourselves to ourselves and didn't bother with reception again.For over $200 a night I expect more than just okay and a little civility in my dealings with reception.","Dear Newspapertaxi,Thank you for taking the time to share your recent hotel experience; I want to personally reassure you that we value our guests and our staff is here to greet you and provide exceptional service.

Elan Hotel,10,"Must be a former motel 6! Make that 5...yeah they bought an old motel and polished the turd with new paint, carpet, and furniture, but forgot to add noise reducing windows (traffic noise in every room), decent climate control (too loud or off are your only options), a new elevator (this one howls and squeaks like rusty nails through sheet metal), a fitness room, or a pool. Okay maybe a pool is asking a bit much, but you ask for a treadmill and the answer is ""go two blocks down and pay $12 for a day pass to Arnold fitness""? I would be deeply embarrassed to work here. They could afford to convert one guest room to a mini gym with a few machines. But this is all about greed isn't it?$200-250 and parking is $26 extra?! The tire place next door lets you park free. Their ""valet only"" parking is just the garage the old motel here used to have. It's just a gouge, plain and simple.The craziest thing about this is that a much better hotel is less than a mile away! Two actually - the Orlando and the Sofitel. Both have real gyms, restaurants, and rooms that aren't noisy enough to keep you awake all night with the elevator creaking, vents howling, echoing hallways, and traffic noise coming in the teensy windows.Do yourself a favor and stay 0.3 miles away for the same price. Oh yeah, and the Sofitel has a pool. Ladies and gentlemen, your winner.","Dear GSWelker,The hotel management and staff would like to thank you for giving us the opportunity to have you as our guest.

Elan Hotel,30,"While I enjoyed many aspects of the Elan I didn't think it was as deserving as the higher rating it was getting on different sites. The rooms themselves are nice --the one we had was a spotless bathroom, the tv had great cable, the space was fine. The front desk staff and door staff were always friendly and there for anything. The breakfast is simple but good, fresh waffles, good coffee, and so on. Plus there is a nice happy hour with wine and snacks. The location is a bit odd for walking anywhere, at least it is close to Beverly Center (but that is under renovation.) But there are so many of the hotel rooms situated around a small cubbyhole of a inner court only, meaning little light and the noise is impossible to keep out. The other option is to a loud large boulevard street. The walls have absolutely no acoustic isolating qualities, heard the different couples sex, tv watching, etc. And for the price, I was surprised it has no fitness center at all.","Dear Passenger121,Thank you for your recent stay and for taking the time to share your recent experience with our fellow trip advisors.

Elan Hotel,30,"Last time I was in LA was in 2003 . But this time that we r back in LA as a couple and with friends & their daughter, this is the 1st time we r staying in a hotel for a couple of days.Since i trust Trip Advisor and saw that the rating is #5 out of 347 hotels in LA, i said this must be a good hotel !Location wise, this is 15-20mins away from where the action is- Rodeo Drive or Hollywood Blvd.One really needs a car to drive around LA because everything seems far and the roads are huge.There is no parking lot for the guests. So we just parked our rented van just along the street.Hotel has valet service too.So here is our experience.Checked in at 3am- very smooth & quick check in procedures.Hotel has two floors.We stayed at a room on the 2nd flr.Bed is huge: King Size.Bathroom has nice amenities, except for toothbrushes, which Elan doesn't provide.( good thing we always bring our own)I am impressed with how "" green"" this hotel is : Elan hotel and the hotel chain where it is a member of, recycles the bits & pcs of the bar soaps which the guests don't fully use up and donate them to countries wherein bar soaps are a necessity for handwashing yet the supply is scarce. Kudos to this hotel for that sustainable Green Action. ( i am a frequent traveler and i am used to the "" conserve your towel"" policies practiced for years now by hotels, but this is the first time i encountered a hotel with this green policy of soap recycling) 👍🏼Since this is our first nite, i have yet to experience the complimentary continental breakfast tomorrow but im hoping it's good.Location: there is a mall walking distance from the hotel. A Taco Bell right across the street, and a Southeast Asian Kitchen. I saw a Marshall's , CV Pharmacy & Big Fat Burger nearby.Inside the room: water ( Evian ) isn't complimentary. It is priced at almost $4.50 a bottle. But the Wolfgang Puck packed Coffee is free. Which i find weird because how can u make coffee when u have to buy their water ? Oh i was told that the faucet water in the bathroom is potable. ( safe for drinking) . Ok then.So far our first nite in the hotel is ok. It's worth spending my bday here on Sunday Oct30. Even with a major jetlag.The room, bathroom, hallways are clean and well lit. Looks new.Attaching some photos for ur appreciation.","Dear Christine B,Welcome Back to Los Angeles and happy belated Birthday!

The majority of the time we do allow for our guests to check in earlier that the normal check-in time; we are sorry that your room was not ready upon your arrival. Los Angeles could be an overwhelming city, many guest find it convenient to rent a car while exploring Los Angeles, in addition there are many other alternatives of exploring; these include private car services, Uber, supper shuttles, tour services and public transportation. I would have to disagree from your comment as the Elan Hotel Location is unique; the hotel is walking distance to 2 of the city’s most well-known shopping malls, The Grove and The Beverly Center. We are also within walking distance to some of Los Angeles finest restaurants, literary next to what’s know as Restaurant Row in Beverly Hills. In addition the hotel is close to many well know attractions for tourist, Rodeo Drive in Beverly Hills as well as Hollywood and the Walk of Fame. We are also located 25 minutes driving distance from Universal Studios, The Staples Center and LA Live Area in Downtown Los Angeles. As stated before, Los Angeles can be overwhelming as it stretches in a never ending mix of cultures and attractions. In Los Angeles, we must allow time for traveling short distances.

When we first arrived, we had to ask multiple times for help with our luggage, barely got any, and had to wheel the luggage cart ourselves as the employee stood there.

We called the desk and they told me to find the manager, then offered a different room (no way were we packing up and moving after being there already a day and a half) and finally sent the workers to another area of the building.

We had a Britax stroller so it was annoying to lift it each time we left or entered the hotel.-Could here a lot of noise from the hallways from our room.I'd recommend the Elan if you don't mind splurging a bit and want a higher end experience and don't require much space within the room (little luggage and only sleeping in room). Convenience is a big plus. I recently also stayed at the Beverly Laurel Motor Hotel a few blocks away which was over $100/night cheaper. I wrote a review for them as well. Personally, I'd choose the Beverly Laurel due to more square footage in the room and price but for you it depends on what you value more.","Dear junepak,A lot has changed since 2015!

Elan Hotel,30,"This is considered a “boutique hotel”, but honestly besides that fact that it has a relatively small number of rooms there is nothing particular boutique about it. The lobby area has a nice design, but the rooms are pretty standard. Room size is a bit on the small side, but the bathroom is surprisingly large (however: lots of unutilized space), I assume that due to the layout of the building. Convenient location for Beverly Hills, west Hollywood etc. Hotel only offers valet parking (at about 25 USD/night).So not a bad hotel, but nothing special either and in my view a bit expensive for what you get.","Dear Guest,Thank you for your review.

Elan Hotel,30,"When I had first read reviews of the hotel, I had assumed the accommodations would have a tiny bit of luxury. The staff was nice and the front desk who checked me in even gave me a glass of wine since I missed the happy hour but you will be disappointed in the room. I got a street facing room on the ground level which had a tiny sliver of a window. The only natural light that entered the room was accompanied by strangers on the street who could look directly into your room. The room itself reminded me of a larger size dorm room. A little dated but reasonably clean. It does have a good location though!","Dear Guest,We do have many luxury features in our guestrooms from our goose down comforter and pillows, personal robe and slippers, and cotton bath sheets and towels just to name a few.

Elan Hotel,30,The Elan is an somewhat upscale hotel in West Hollywood that has a lot of expensive hotels. Two of us stayed there in February 2015. It is value priced and the rooms are small but OK. The price is much less that other hotels in the area. Twenty-five dollars for parking seems steep but may be the norm for the area. I have stayed there several times and never been disappointed.,"Dear Guests,We are a very good value for the dollar especially when one considers our complimentary expanded continental breakfast, evening wine and cheese reception, and Wi-Fi, are all included in the price of the room! Our nightly valet parking charges are among the lowest in the area and we have not increased our prices in over four years. Our guests have as many in and out privileges as one may need with no additional cost. We appreciate your continued patronage and look forward to your return visit!

Elan Hotel,10,I was so disappointed with this hotel after reading reviews. I had booked a king room through the hotel for a 7 night stay. We checked in and were put on the first floor overlooking the back with a very small window. I asked if there were any other rooms and was told no. The desk clerk said he would make a note that if any rooms opened up over the rest of the week he would let us know. I checked on line for availability for that night and found king rooms available yet we were told there were none. In the room there was only 1 luggage rack and no where else to put our 2nd suitcase. We asked twice for a second luggage rack and were told there weren't any. The following morning I checked out and wasn't even asked how our stay was and why we were leaving after only 1 night. customer service is not a strong point of this hotel. The bed was bad. The showerhead pointed to the back wall and It wouldn't budge when we tried to adjust the angle. The sink didn't drain without holding the stopper up. The air conditioner didn't work well. The breakfast was almost inedible and the coffee was cold. I can't think of 1 good thing to say about this hotel,"Dear Guests,We are sorry that we did not meet your expectations as it is our goal for all of our guests to “experience exceptional service” during their stay with us. After reviewing your reservation I see there was no request for a specific room location. As you mentioned, we offered to move you to a different room the next day and our Concierge did everything he could do to make you feel comfortable.In regards to the room HVAC system, our maintenance team found the unit to be working fine. Our guest rooms are inspected daily after each guest checks out to insure that everything is in good working order for the next guest.The pastries for our expanded continental breakfast are delivered fresh each morning.

Elan Hotel,20,"Just because this hotel has only 40 rooms does not make it a boutique hotel. In no way is this a ""boutique"" hotel. The room was a slightly spruced up Holiday Inn room, a little worn out. The AC is a room unit and to get the room even slightly cool I had to call reception - while the thermostat looks like you are controlling it, they actually control it from the front desk. I was hugely disappointed mostly because the description of this hotel is simply misleading. Perhaps if I was expecting an old, slightly spruced up hotel with minimal amenities (no one to help with the bags, for example) I might not have been quite so disappointed. The price was high for what it delivered. After one night I moved to the Andaz - which while slightly (and I mean only slightly) more expensive, is truly a boutique, upscale, terrific place to stay. I tied to get glasses and ice for the room and they only have 5 oz thick Holiday Inn glasses (only ones available anywhere in the hotel) and a cheezy ice bucket. No room service; no bar; only a little breakfast nook with cheap stuff for breakfast, and mediocre wine and a few lumps of cheese for ""happy hour.""

Elan Hotel,30,We stayed at Elan recently after reading great reviews on Trip Advisor. We needed a place near family and loved the idea of staying in a boutique style hotel.

Elan Hotel,20,"I usually agree with Tripadvisor reviews, which is why I booked this hotel. First, room was very noisy. Our room had a nice view of a fence with iron spikes at the top, right next to the alley with all of the delivery trucks. The hotel does offer complimentary cheese and wine every night, but then only uses single ply toilet paper. What? The room was clean, if small. The bed was hard. Overall the entire hotel smelled of Fabreeze, which is off putting. I couldn't go anywhere and get away from the smell. We booked 6 nights and checked out after one.","Dear Guest,We are happy that you found the Élan Hotel on Trip Advisor and decided to make your booking with us based on prior reviews. Additionally, we are sorry that you decided to cut your stay short. I would have loved the chance to speak to you regarding your stay with us.

Bed was really hard and uncomfortable and included breakfast was not much to rave about, but could not fault the exceptional customer service we received. This hotel is smaller than most and therefore the feel is much more familiar and welcoming.Bathroom wasvery clean (a little smaller than I would like) but overall we enjoyed our stay. Location - hop on hop off bus a 2 min walk from the hotel, large shopping centre vertually across the road, a fantatic local Japanese restuarant less than a min walk, chemist, supermarket, and some budget shops less than 5 min walk.

Elan Hotel,20,"The good - included continental breakfast, included wine and cheese in the evening and computers in the lobby. It was a pretty good location (just across from the Beverly Center in West Hollywood). Recommend going to the Farmers Market / the Groves, rather than the Beverly Centre (we walked there but many people would get a cab or drive). There was a coin laundry a few blocks up.However, the bed was VERY hard. We booked for five nights and after the first night didn't know if we could last that long. The manager offered use of a mattress topper which made it a lot better. The staff did not seem very happy, and the place just had a bad vibe.There were keys to the mini bar. We left it unlocked one day and they tried to charge us for minibar on check-out, but managed to sort it out.

Elan Hotel,30,"I stayed at the Elan as a last minute Saturday night in LA (we came a day earlier than we had planned for a week trip). All the other hotels in the area were at least $100 more! We actually booked that morning - they had a couple rooms left.This is a great area - convenient to West Hollywood, La Cienega, and Beverly Center. We arrived at 8pm, and immediately after check in took a cheap cab to the Sunset Strip as it was my first trip to LA. On a nice night you could actually walk to the Strip, but it was cool and getting rainy (plus its an uphill walk).The room was ok. Our 1st floor room had a slider to the side walkway of the hotel - I didnt like being that close to people walking by, but I wasn't at the room very long, and I dont people generally walk out there anyway. As long as you are on a higher floor it wont be an issue. the bathroom was huge and the robes nice.The best part of this place besides location was the breakfast. Wow - I was expecting coffee and a banana when they said continental, but this was great. Selection of coffees, OJ, Lemon Water and some others. Boiled eggs, Bagels (with toaster nearby), jam, oatmeal, yogurt, fruit, pastries and muffins. I think I am leaving out some stuff. Anyway, I was impressed this was included as part of the price of the room. This spread at a diner or coffee shop would have been at least $15pp if they had this selection. Unlimited made it even better!For some this may not be important but I was on a long flight to get here and had lots of things planned so it was nice to get a solid - quick breakfast without having to fork out more money. A few Newspapers were available for free as well!The breakfast area was really nice too - some tables, couch with coffee table and a couple flat screen tv's. Also a few computers were available for use.Overall seemed like a glamourous budget hotel, safe, clean, well situated and staff very motivated to help. No real amenities like a gym or pool but like i said, a great base and good service.We spent the next 3 nights at the Sofitel down the street which was REALLY nice, with pool, gym, spa, and on-site restaurant / nightclub, but you'll pay 20-30% more on any given night. We got a good deal due to it being the week of thanksgiving so it was worth it.If you like to shop, the Beverly Center and Nordstrom's Rack are right there. Melrose Ave is a few blocks north. Robertson St with all the new designers is a 15 min walk, and the Grove about 25 min walk the other way.I'm not big on buses or public transportation, but did take a bus down Melrose Ave one night home from Pink's Hot Dogs (to Melrose at LaCienega) for $1.50 each, because we were sick of paying 10x that for cabs to go just a mile or so down the street.Overall I would stay again, but if I were spending a lot of time at the hotel and got a good deal, I'd upgrade to the Sofitel.","Dear Guest,The title of your review says it all…and thanks for mentioning our great location.

Elan Hotel,30,"This hotel was pretty good for what it was. My husband and I found the hotel on Expedia and booked two nights over the weekend at about $210 a night. We thought the price was pretty good for the location of the hotel, and for a Friday and Saturday night. It's in a decent neighborhood within walking distance to the Beverly Center and other restaurants. There is no self-parking which is not uncommon for a small boutique hotel, so you can either park in a metered spot or valet. Valet was about $26 a day after taxes, and we thought it was worth it. The valet staff was always on top of it. We got our car in and out of valet several times and each time we would just call ahead of time to have our car ready and our car was always right outside within 15 min. Our room at the hotel was not bad. It was on the first floor and opened into a small courtyard facing other rooms. That said, it was not very private if you opened the curtains so we kept the curtains closed most of the time which made the room dark. And the fact that all the lights in the room were fluorescent lighting didn't help, but overall, that didn't bother us. The room was really tiny and the bathroom was pretty small too with virtually no counter space so I had to put all of our toiletries and my makeup on the desk outside of the bathroom. But again, this is not uncommon for a small boutique hotel and it wasn't that big of a deal to us. The light in our bathroom made an annoying buzzing sound and the bed was a little firm and stiff for my tastes though my husband thought the bed was comfortable. The walls were not sound proof as we could hear noises all around us including doors shutting and people talking constantly. When we first checked in, we smelled pot in the hallway and the smell seeped into our room because there isn't a great seal around the door which I'm sure is also what contributed to how easily we could hear outside noises. I called the front desk about the pot smell and they took care of it right away. Overall though, the room was clean and updated pretty well for, what I could tell was, a really old building. It was also nice that they provided complimentary wifi even though it was kind of slow, breakfast in the mornings, and wine and cheese receptions in the evenings. The staff was also really friendly and courteous. All in all, the hotel and the location were pretty good for the money.","Dear Guest,I am happy to read that you found the Élan Hotel through Expedia.com for your weekend stay with us.

Elan Hotel,30,We stayed here last Fall for a weekend trip to LA. The staff is very attentive and personable. The location is great for sight seeing in LA. The breakfast buffet had good variety and the food was always fresh.The room is clean but I was not exactly wowed with the quality given the prior good reviews on Trip Advisor. It seemed to be on the same quality level as a Holiday Inn.The only down side to the hotel was that our room faced a busy street. Early Sunday morning there were people outside preparing for a charity walk and it was extremely noisy. We called the front desk twice to notify the noise was disrupting our sleep. It was only after I called the second time and requested to speak to the manager that the front desk person spoke with the individuals outside to quiet down (which they did). The hotel did not charge us for parking during our stay due to our inconvenience.,"Dear Guest,Thanks for the review of your stay last October 2010. I appreciate your comments about the attentive staff and will pass your comments on to them. I'm glad that you enjoyed the morning breakfast that we provide as well.We feel that our rooms are comfortable and relaxing and continue to update them on an ongoing basis. We are currently enhancing some of our room amenities and I am sure that our guest will appreciate the upgrades. We will be installing new mirrored closet doors in all of our guest rooms soon and we are upgrading our bedding package as well. In addition we are replacing the lamps and all of the artwork in the guest rooms. The final product will be stunning.I believe that you are referring to the annual Los Angeles Marathon that took place last October while you were here. I am sorry if this event disrupted your stay during your visit but it is geared to raise money for a very worthy cause.I appreciate your comments and thank you for taking the time to post a review of the Élan Hotel.Regards,Joel MajorsGeneral Manager",Trip type: Traveled as a couple,Date of stay: October 2010,"Response from jmajorselan, General Manager at Elan Hotel","Responded Sep 14, 2011"
Elan Hotel,20,"I went to Los Angeles on business and stayed over for one night. The only good thing was the location of the hotel. The room was small and very outdated. There was never anyone on duty outside for valet parking..ended up parking at a meter more than once. When I think boutique, I actually think charming and very nice. Neither....will not stay again.","Dear Guest,Thank you for your review and for mentioning our great location. We have undergone a major renovation not long ago and continue to upgrade our amenities so that we offer a very competitive product to our guests.

Elan Hotel,20,"I would like to preference this by saying that we most likely had the WORST room in the entire hotel. With that being said, even your WORST room in a hotel should be better than staying at home... or at least, a Holiday Inn. But no, this had more than just a jail cell with a horrible color scheme.When we arrived late, there was no one to park our car at the valet station. and when we went in, it took forever to finally get someone to help with the car. So, my friend is in the car at the curb waiting for the valet to come get the keys and park the car, and what does teh valet guy do? Stand there about 10 feet from teh car and stare into space?! I watched him through the hotel lobby doors, thining that my friend was on teh ohone or something... 10 minutes later I come outside and peer into the car and my friend is like ""where is the valet guy?!"" I turn to the valet and ask him what he's waiting for? His reposne ""oh, he was still in the car."" SO GO UP AND OPEN THE DOOR AND PARK THE CAR?! I don't understand just standing there 10 feet from the car? We should have left then.When we checked into the room, it was about the size of a closet. bathroom, jail cell, what have you. Tiny room with the curtains jutting out into the room, taking away more space. A huge UGLY lamp that descended from the ceiling, and bulky dresser, leaving ZERO room to manuver. The bed was not comfortable, and it was so bad all we could do was laugh. We called to switch rooms, but they were sold out.The next morning, I went to go get breakfast, which was complimentary and pathetic. We did not enjoy our stay and will never return - #SiberianGulag","Dear Guest,Thank you for your recent stay with us. I would like the opportunity to speak with you regarding some of the comments in your review. In regards to your comment about the Valet, I will like to say that they are trained to wait until a guest has finished their telephone call before opening the car door. This is a courtesy to the guest as they may not want to be interupted during their conversation.In addition, we feel that our guestrooms are stylish, clean, and comfortable. It was not long ago the we remodelled the entire hotel. As a matter of fact, we are getting ready to do another mild renovation this fall to once again upgrade the lamps, bedding, closet doors, and all of the artwork in the rooms.Finally, I would like to mention that so many of our guests enjoy our morning breakfast as I continue to receive so many e-mails and comments on TripAdvisor.

Elan Hotel,30,"The recent Trip Advisor rating of this hotel as #1 in Los Angeles and #2 in the nation was beguiling enough to entice us to book a room. The reality is that this is a pleasant enough hotel (though with a motel-ish feel), but simply doesn't deserve a #1 or 2 rating on anyone's list of best hotels in any market of significant size. Staff are friendly, courteous, and helpful. The room we were given was clean and functional. Complimentary breakfast and wine and cheese evenings are nice. This would be a good choice for location or (possibly) price, but for a traveler seeking the comfort and convenience of the kind of luxury hotel that is implied by a high user rating, this is not the place.","Dear Guest,Thank you for your recent stay at the Élan Hotel. Our Trip Advisor rating is one that our loyal guests have ranked the Élan and we appreciate it very much. The score is based on amenities, service, and value. We feel that we do offer a good value for the dollar by offering a nicely appointed room with upscale amenities as well as a complimentary expanded continental breakfast, evening wine & cheese reception, and free Wi-Fi. In addition, the staff works hard to accommodate all of our valued guests and we like to treat everyone like it is their “home away from home”.

Elan Hotel,30,"I wanted to like this place, but I really have no idea how it gets the reviews it does on here.So, starting from the top...Valet is fine - he wasn't out there when I arrived and so I waited, unsure of where you were actually supposed to pull up to for 5-10 minutes. Upon retrieving my car on other days, it took a good 15 minutes, so be sure to call down early.Check-in was fine - front desk staff is extremely nice and helpful.Rooms look good on the surface - stylish and redone fairly recently. Bed was comfy as were linens and pillows. Walls are VERY thin though. I had to run to CVS for earplugs as I could hear every word of the person in the room next to me. The balconies are also a little sketchy - I could have climbed into my neighbors room, especially since the maid undid the lock and bar that drops both days so that anyone could enter from the outside.The maid also turned on the alarm on my second day - imagine my surprise when it went off extremely early and had not the previous day. Water pressure in the shower was nice, but no fan.The continental breakfast was nothing to write home about - seriously, the Hampton Inn is better. Hardly any healthy options - mainly sugary cereals and muffins and cereal bars. A few bananas and apples and no whole grain toast or bagels.The wine and cheese was nice - surprisingly the wine wasn't the cheapest out there - it was all Penfolds. Good cheese selection too.Worst part was the lack of fitness center. They used to have an agreement with a nearby club, but its since closed and they make no mention of this on their website or when checking in. You find out early in the morning when you want to go to the gym. Come on - can't you convert one room to a fitness room?!Overall, there are many better options for the price. And frankly, if you're willing to spend just $25-50 more, you can stay at the much better Sofitel a block away.","Dear Guest,Thank you for your recent stay with us! We appreciate your comments as they help to build our quality of service and better understand our guest’s needs. I’d like to touch on a few of your comments. Firstly, we do offer 24-hour Valet Parking service for all of our guests. Most guests prefer to come in to the hotel and check-in and then have their car parked. I must say that our Valet Parking is easy-in and out and I do not understand why it would take longer that a few minutes to retrieve your car being that the garage is on site and just one level below the hotel. Thank you for mentioning our staff members as they all work very hard and we are very proud of them. I am glad that you liked the rooms and I would like to mention that even though some rooms may have adjoining balconies all entry ways are very secure. I’m sorry that you did not prefer our complimentary breakfast. We do offer fresh fruit, yogurt, and a variety of cereal bars for the health conscience. I am happy that you liked our wine & cheese reception. We do offer several types of cheese and different varieties of wine from time to time. I would like to mention that at one time we did have a Fitness Center on property and we found that it was not utilized enough to keep it in operation. However, there are options in the area if one would like a good workout. Thank you for your opinion.

Elan Hotel,30,"I took Trip Advisors advise and tried this hotel out on my recent business trip to Los Angeles. The location was great as it was within walking distance to Beverly center Mall. There was a fast food dinner across the street. As for the hotel room, the room was a little dark and hence made reading in bed difficult. The room was a bit small and for a large bathroom, the sink was a bit small and they could have had 2 sinks on the counter. If you did not mind continental breakfast, then its great but if you are like me who needs a hearty breakfast.. then its going to be tough. One disappointing point is that there is no porters in the hotel. Hence, you need to help yourself with the bags. The hotel valet service was good as they were very friendly and helpful. Overall it was a good moderate hotel","Dear Guest,We are happy that you found our hotel through TripAdvisor.com for your recent business trip to Los Angeles.

Elan Hotel,10,"I was not allowed to reserve a room because I was accompanied by my father who has a disability requiring a service dog. I was told over the phone that the hotel has a blanket policy that no ""pets"" are allowed. I politely informed the gentleman I was speaking to that service animals are not considered pets. He replied that it didn't matter. Needless to say, I am disappointed by their non-compliance with the law:Section 54.2(a), Right of individuals with disabilities to be accompanied by a trained service dog","Dear Maxxodd,Thank you for your comment here on TripAdvisor, it is a very important distinction that you make and one that needs to be emphasized in our staff training.

Elan Hotel,20,"The location of this hotel has both pros and cons. The pros are that it is locaed within walking distance of good restaurants and the hotel will provide a list. It is convenient to a shopping center and Cedars Sinai. Wine and cheese are offered in the afternoons and a continental breakfast is offered until 10 AM. The lobby is nice appointed. The cons are that it located next to an auto tire service and there are no views. The guest rooms are small and resemble an updated rooming house. The hotel is clean. Parking is expensive with only valet service available - no self-park. In my opinion, this is a 2 star hotel with an expensive price point for the room. The internet is unreliable and quite slow.","Dear 411Vacationer,Thank you for your comments regarding your recent stay at the Élan Hotel. As you mentioned, many guests select our hotel for a variety of reasons including walking distance to shopping, local sights and Cedars-Sinai Medical Center. Our lobby is a major focal point of the hotel and our guests really enjoy having breakfast or the evening wine reception while doing a little people watching on the street or even watching cars go by. While we are in a very good area of Los Angeles, it is true that there is a tire store across the street. This is what makes Los Angeles so eclectic. In addition, we are just a two story hotel so there is not much opportunity for a view. Thanks for mentioning the cleanliness of the hotel as our Housekeeping Manager will appreciate hear this comment very much. Incidentally, I’m not sure how we can be compared to a rooming house. All of our rooms are nicely decorated for you… our guest. It has been just about a year and a half since our last renovation. Lastly, our parking rates are among some of the lowest in the area and it is true that we only offer valet parking. I am sorry if you experienced and internet issues while you were here.

Elan Hotel,30,"I booked the Elan Hotel in LA in a large part due to the reviews on Trip Advisor. However, I do not understand why it is rated so highly. The location was very good, the rooms were clean, the staff was excellent in terms of being service-oriented and polite, and there was free wi-fi and use of computers and a printer in the lobby. But, the breakfast (included) was poor, especially regarding the quality of certain items available, and the ""turn-down"" service actually occurred when the housekeeper initially serviced the room in the latter part of the day Also, if you decide to take advantage of the valet parking, be sure to inspect your car after it is delivered to you.Overall, this hotel seems to be an old one that was slightly modernized and is attempting to be in a higher class than it actually is. (Some staff members have multiple roles.) The price charged per room is excessive for such a hotel, as is the fact that it is rated #2 in LA.","Dear Guest,I appreciate your comments on your recent visit. Our rating on Trip Advisor is actually a result of many of the items that you have mentioned in your review. We are in a prime location for shopping and there are many restaurants to choose from as well.

All of these are free to the guest and are not included in the room rate. Thank you for mentioning our customer service as I will pass this comment on to the staff. They will appreciate hearing this.

Elan Hotel,10,"The bad: A man from hotel housekeeping barged into the room unannounced and without knocking. No sense of privacy here!Management made excuses regarding the debacle. Also, stayed in ""executive king room"" and it was very cramped. Cont. breakfast had old ""fresh"" fruit.The good: Cleanliness, near Beverly Center and The Grove. Hotel front desk staff were professional and accommodating.","Dear Guest,We see this as an opportunity to once again profusely apologize for the intrusion of your privacy, but also to again let you know that once a guest has checked out of the hotel, staff will update the daily departure list as showing the room as unoccupied. Our housekeeper indeed should have knocked to double-check that you were actually gone, even though it was already late morning, and you were no longer registered as a guest at the hotel. We appreciate this certainly was an embarrassing moment, however it will not happen again.

The rooms are small and plain with no view, the internet is slow, the halls are grim and look like something from a chain motel. No self-parking available, street parking is either metered or by permit only, and the valet parking verges on highway robbery at $19/day since there is no alternative.

Elan Hotel,30,"I was really looking forward to my stay in the Elan Hotel which I booked as a treat for myself after a trip across the States. However I was slightly dissapointed with the hotel which I feel did not live up to the reviews on trip advisor. Firstly, I was kept waiting at check in for five minutes while the receptionist took a phone call. This may not seem like a big deal but I was tired and just wanted to get to my room. He did apologize for the delay but I felt he should have acknowledged my presence at least when he was on the phone. He was very friendly and told me about the breakfast and wine and cheese. I then told him that I was under 21, which he should have realized by looking at my passport a few minutes previously. I then went up to my room which was small but still felt luxurious. Ten minutes later, however, I got a phone call from reception to inform me that all alcohol would have to be removed from my room and they would send someone up. I understand they have to do this but it just felt like a massive inconvenience when all I wanted to do was fall into bed. The next day the maid attempted to put alcohol back into the room and I had to explain to her that I was told I cannot have access to alcohol according to the hotel's policy and she accepted this but I feel she should have known! To top matters off there was a small fire in the hotel one of the mornings I stayed there. I felt we got minimal explanation and the hotel smelled of smoke for most of the day which made my stay unpleasant.The location was good, close to the shops which was what I was interested in and the free internet was great. The breakfast was basic but it was appreciated as it is such a rarity to receive a complimentary breakfast in a hotel these days.Overall I feel I may have been unlucky with my stay. Although the room was lovely, if slightly small, I don't feel my stay was worth the money.","Dear Guest,We are very happy that you selected the Elan Hotel as your destination to Los Angeles and we appreciate this very much as we realize that there are other options available to you. I am sorry that you had to wait for our Guest Services Representative to finish a call before he could check you in.

Elan Hotel,30,"I booked this hotel because of the good reviews on TA. Well I must say I am a bit disappointed. It's partially my fault for not researching the area a bit better. I first stayed at a hotel in Venice Beach and really liked the proximity to the beach and the activities around there. I changed because the hotel in Venice Beach had a very high weekend price.The location of the Elan Hotel is ok I guess. It is right on Beverly Blvd and near the Beverly Center but I personally did not like the area too much. It seemed a bit scruffy and not very appealing to me. Also Beverly Blvd is quite a loud street and my room was facing the road which meant that I could here all the trucks and cars passing by the whole time since the room did not have an sound proof at all. I could even hear the voices of people walking on the sidewalk. I personally was not that bothered by it but still it was a bit annoying. So I would recommend people who are sensitive to noise to get a room facing away from the main street.Check-In staff was efficient but not overly friendly, just ok. The room itself was very nicely furnished and everything was working fine. Housekeeping is probably the best asset of the hotel as they really took care of the room with a lot of attention to detail and really made an effort.Breakfast was quite good with a good choice of items from cereals to bagels to hard boiled eggs.Valet parking was OK but a bit annoying since you always have to wait for them to get the car in the garage next door. It would be so much easier if they would have self parking. However since it's Beverly Hills, you are stuck with valet parking almost everywhere.So I guess if you want to be in Beverly Hills then stay there, if you are a first time visitor to LA I would not recommend it, since traffic around there is pretty bad at times and the freeway is not really that close to go to places.I guess the experience was ok but that's all. I will not come back again.","Dear Guest,We are sorry to hear of the issues regarding your stay. We thank you very much for your comments because we take our on-line reviews very seriously. We have a very dedicated staff at our property who work very hard to ensure our guests receive an “excellent service experience.”Valet parking is not mandatory at our property; however you will find street parking to be available during limited days and hours. We do have some guests who opt to self-park in the neighborhood behind the hotel, but we recommend they pay attention to street parking signage- you don't want to get towed on street sweep days!Our location is quite popular with guests who want to be in West LA/Hollywood for shopping, nightlife, proximity to Cedars-Sinai, film studios, and the attractions in the neighborhood.Thank you for you comments regarding our breakfast. We think we've got one of the best around! We also have a complimentary wine reception that runs daily from 5-7 that is very popular.We hope you will give us a try on your next visit and allow us the opportunity to serve you better.Kindest Regards,Elan Hotel Management and Staff",Trip type: Traveled solo,Date of stay: December 2009,"Response from ElanMGR, Manager at Elan Hotel","Responded Dec 30, 2009"
Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,10,"We paid $330 CAD for one night in a standard queen room. For this price, we were assuming the room would be excellent; however, this was not the case at all. The pictures of the room on the site are misleading and make the room look twice the size it is. The room is essentially a ten foot by ten foot (estimate) closet - there was not even enough room to open your suitcase on the floor. The single window in the room looked directly at a concrete wall next to the 'hotel' which added to the dungeon feel of the room. The bathroom looked like a prison bathroom - with a concrete stand-up shower and dirt on the wall that looked like it could have been blood. The bathroom was barely large enough for two people to stand up in. When I addressed my concerns with the receptionist who checked us in, she offered little help saying that was the size of the room. Furthermore, the mandatory hotel fee is ridiculous - it includes a one hour happy hour and breakfast from 6-10; however, this should be optional, not necessary. Regarding the hotel lobby/lounge, the artwork is interesting and probably the biggest selling point of the entire place; however, the hotel felt old without the charm that they were obviously trying to accomplish. I would not recommend anyone to stay here - you can find much better value for a much better price. The hotels we stayed at nights prior to our stay, and the nights following our stay here, were ten times better for a fraction of the price.","Thank you for your feedback.The Crescent Beverly Hills proudly provides great value for guests of Beverly Hills for over 9 decades.You had booked our entry level room category which is an economical choice for travelers who are seeking a central Beverly Hills location on a budget.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,30,"Very quaint hotel but nothing looked like the pictures on website. The bar is tiny, the outside terrace looks nothing like the pictures and we spent 5 minutes there and left. The smallest and most disappointing thing of all was my room. The door could not open all the way because it hit the queen size bed. There was about a foot clearance between the end of the bed and the wall, approx 2 feet between side of bed and the wall--maybe smaller. The closet was a tiny wardrobe. The bath was decent size except the sink is so close to the wall that my right elbow hit the door multiple times while drying my hair. All the space is between the counter and the shower. I joked with my kids that I was staying at the Hobbit Hotel. Unfortunately at almost $300 a night my joke wasn't funny. When I went to take a shower there were o towels. They were brought quickly though. The pluses: walking distance to Rodeo drive and quick Uber drive to Beverly Center. Staff was very friendly and helpful. Would I stay there again--no.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,30,"It is kind of a Boutique Hotel, with a pretty nice design in all ambients. It is a pity that part of it was being reformed while we were there, so I couldn't check out the final result. All staff was extremely polite and solicitous. It is located really really close to the best part of the famous Rodeo Drive, with plenty of restaurants, cafes, clubs and boutiques. There is a vallet service (not included) and you are supposed to also tip it, not a surprise, and actually the vallet guy is also really nice, so it was always a well deserved tip. Next time I go to LA I will go back for sure.The only thing that didn't go really nice was that by mistake, my credit card was billed twice because I had paid my stay in advance by booking.com and at the moment of the checkout the person that closed my account there didn't notice that.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,30,"This hotel is in a great location in Beverly Hills. Right near the restaurants, shopping, etc. The rooms are really beautiful (although tiny unless you get the king size room); however, there is very little wifi functionality... We had to go use the lobby/restuarant area to do work during our four day stay which was extremely inconvenient. Also, we had to switch rooms because the only King room available (which we booked and paid for) shared a wall with the front lobby/restuarant! Can you imagine trying to sleep with that on the other side of your head? Impossible. So we switched to a much smaller room that was a black hole for cell phone/internet reception. The upside of this hotel was the extremely nice and curteous staff (with the exception of the constantly grumpy/rude valet). The blonde lady in the bar was so so nice and recommended a lot of great restaurants and Winston at the front desk was more than hospitable. Other than these two, I'd say the stay was so so. Nothing spectacular, more of a headache if nothing else.","Thank you kindly for all of your kind words about our staff.Yes, we are just wrapping up the last parts of our renovation and redecoration, which includes additional sound proofing to the room that you mention.I am sorry that you did not try our LA style restaurant and lounge bar terrace - where the ""hub-bub"" was coming from during the night..Thank you for your comments,Susan and James - Guest Care Team",Trip type: Traveled on business,Date of stay: June 2013,"Response from Guest Care T, General Manager at Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills","Responded Jul 4, 2013"
Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,30,"This hotel is in a convenient location within walking distance of numerous fine restaurants. The terrace at the entrance is a beautiful place to enjoy a drink and observe the numerous posers that seem to occupy this moneyed area of L.A, close to upscale boutqiues and restuarants. The room was fine, stylish, roomy, comfortable, if a little dark, and I had no problems with the soundproofing and noise of other guests which was my only concern upon booking. My only gripe was the level of service which varied greatly. The check-in receptionist was friendly and helpful, however the opposite applied with the surly moron who oversaw the check-out.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,20,"Our stay at the Crescent Hotel was rather disappointing. First, as a positive, the room (premium queen) was adequate as per size and décor with a lot of electrical outlets for recharging phones, etc. The room was very poorly illuminated, though, making any kind of extended reading or writing well-nigh impossible after sunset. If you enjoy leisure reading, had to do paper work, or attempt a crossword puzzle, forget about it. Also, the door to the room did not have a peephole, which as I understand it, is an important safety feature for guests. Winston, the reception clerk when we arrived, however, was pleasant and helpful.The real problem came when we checked out. When my wife booked the reservation with manager Tristan Sapp, Tristan said that there weren’t any petit queen rooms available for that date so he would upgrade us to a premium queen room. Tristan, also, sent an email confirming the reservation. The unpleasantness happened on check-out. When we were checking out, there was a $57 fee for the upgrade to the premium queen room. This charge was not mentioned in my wife’s discussion with Tristan or in the email confirming the reservation. We explained this to the desk clerk on duty. He insisted we had been told this. After it was obvious we weren’t going to cave in and pay the fee, he did grudgingly drop the $57 charge chastising us that he was doing this “even though you didn’t listen..” referring apparently to the fabricated conversation regarding the extra charge my wife had when making the reservations.)It’s hard for me not to think that this attempt to milk us out of an extra 57 bucks is a practice this hotel uses to take advantage of inattentive or unassertive patrons. As far as the stupidity and rudeness of the clerk telling us “you didn’t listen,” well, that’s the hotel’s look out…",Thank you for posting a review of your experience at our hotel. Your opinions are very important to us. It is absolutely not our practice to bill our guests for any charges they are not made aware of during the reservation process. We have had an overwhelmingly positive response to our Living Social promotion. As a result the Petit Queen room featured in the promotion has been sold out for many dates. In an effort to allow our guests to utilize the great deal they purchased we have offered many guests an opportunity to upgrade to a lager room at a fee. I'm am very sorry this was not made clear to you when you reserved your room and that it was not handled more tactfully during your check out. Our confirmation letters have been updated to reflect the surcharge as an add-on for those who elect the upgrade option. I hope that you will give us the opportunity to make up for this experience. We are currently upgrading the entire hotel and I'd love to have you come and see us again once this is finished.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,20,"You might have seen the reviews here mentioning how small the rooms are. Well this is no hype, they really are small. The hotel masquerades as a boutique hotel, but really it's just cosmetic, it's just a small hotel with small rooms. As a tourist you don't come to LA to spend time in your room, so the basic essentials of it being clean and near touristy attractions was all i required, and in this sense it filled the role. Some of the charges bordered on ridiculous though, $28 to park our rented car for the night, was insane. Complete and utter rip off. I'd also been ringing home using a prepaid calling card via a 1800 free phone number, but this hotel decided it will charge you for even free phone calls! Was annoyed by that. Was told and made to sign that if i lost my key (you don't get room cards here) that i'd have to pay nigh on $75! However, like i say it was very clean, and conveniant to travel to the touristy areas of Hollywood and Beverly Hills so it wasn't a nightmare.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,10,"We checked into the Crescent for two nights, and everything looked like it was going to be great. The Hotel is cool-Art Deco, very clean, and room, small, but looked great. The room could have used a chair, the platform bed lacked real support. However, the neighborhood is beautiful. The location is very convenient to Beverly Hills shopping, Rodeo Drive and so many restaurants. OK, the valet parking only was $28 a night, but the room was only $129 through Bookit, so what the heck.Then the place started to lose its luster. They put us in room 220, right above the bar, and you heard music and bar noise until well after midnight. We didn’t feel much like moving in the middle of the night, and are relatively heavy sleepers, so we tolerated it. We shouldn’t have.The next morning we were awakened by even more music (at least this time it was Frank Sinatra). The continental breakfast consisted of a thermos of coffee, another for hot water, and 3 bite size dry pastries on a cake stand, surrounded by dirty dishes. See photo. We left for the day and returned in the late afternoon- housekeeping had not been to our room. We later left for dinner, and returned later that evening, still no housekeeping. But the situation was worse, made us forget we didn't have housekeepimng. The bar down stairs was in party mode and the heavy beat of the music traveled throughout the hotel. It was loud. No room could have been spared. Ours of course wasn’t, directly over the bar.It went on well after midnight, and I had to go down and confront this situation. The night manager could only offer to turn down the music a bit. No offer of another room. Explained there was nothing he could do because I booked through a third party (Note: I have found that booking through a 3rd party like Bookit restricts your reservation at the hotel. Also, special requests, like an extra pillow or nonsmoking room, are often not honored) The noise went on even later.The next morning we checked out and were asked the classic “How was your stay.” I said it was horrible, and explained why. Again I was told about the third party booking rule, nothing they could do. He went further to explain that I should have asked for another room earlier. How did this become my fault? They knew there was going to be a noisy party, I didn’t. We just left.Later that day we were called and they did comp one night. Amazing, it turns out they CAN make an adjustment on a third party booking. But that didn’t change the fact that they irresponsible and ruined my weekend, and to them it was all my fault. What did I learn? DO NOT STAY HERE. No class at all.","I am very sorry to hear your stay was not to your satisfaction.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,30,"Stayed there one night--I would say you will love or hate this place based on what you are looking for in a hotel.Check-in was pleasant and our brief interactions with the staff were pleasant and professional.No elevator- they did offer to carry our bags upstairs.The room--if you are trying to impress someone this is not the hotel for you. The rooms like others have said resemble small dorm rooms. Two people have trouble fitting in the room. For one person it would be o.k. I have the say the decor is 'modern/trendy' gone bad. Instead of looking trendy to me it looked cold and sterile, totally devoid of any charm or character. A nice prison cell?The bathroom drove me crazy. First of all the lighting was horrible. Two ceiling fluorescent bulbs partially covered, that's it. If you wanted to put on make-up, shave, etc good luck, better bring your own light. The vessel sink on the countertop took forever to drain and the design guaranteed water all over the very limited counter and/or floor. Which brings me to the decor--concrete floor, counter, shower, etc. I recognized it as the trendy 'concrete' finish--my husband doesn't keep up with the trends as much as I do thought it looked like a scratch coat that is used before tile is set. Water pressure in the shower is excellent though and lots of hot water.The location is outstanding, shops and restaurants galore within walking distance. Add the warm, beautiful sunshine with the ability to eat and shop steps from the hotel really enhances the appeal of the hotel.Can't comment on the pastries/coffee as they were only served from 7-9 a.m. I get up at 5 a.m. every day, no way will I have gotten up and showered and dressed by 9 a.m. when on vacation so I would suggest they change that to at least 10 a.m.I can't recommend or not recommend this hotel because it really just depends on what you are looking for.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,20,"I am generally a fan of boutique hotels and didn't come in the door here expecting the trappings of big and fancy, but I was very disappointed with my stay here. My first impression was the valet, who wasn't at his station, but around the corner smoking a cigarette or something. When he did come over, rather than welcoming me, he first admonished me that I needed to back the car up a foot because I was encroaching the red zone. I grabbed my bag and walked into the lobby - tiny but cute, with a well-stocked bar and music playing. There was a loud group sitting in the lobby drinking and chatting, and the acoustics made the decibel level even greater, plus I think they were trying to talk over the music. Ugh. The bright ray of sunshine was the young man at the desk - Justice, I think he said his name was (or at least over the noise, I that's what I thought I heard). He was delightful, someone who really knows what the service/hospitality business is about. In addition to checking me into my room, he helped find a charger for my phone and offered empathy for my tedious travel day. Every hotel could use someone like him.No elevator here, so if you have a second floor room, I'd suggest going light on the bag. Walking down the hallway, it was clear to me that his place was some kind of apartment conversion. The rooms are appointed nicely...the bed was fantastic, TV modern, nice amenities, and the AC works great, which was important since it was almost 100 here today. Downsides to the room - you can hear EVERYTHING in the rooms on either side. When the guy in the next room got into the shower at 3:30 am, you would have thought he was in the shower in my room the water in the pipes was so loud. The wireles works, but I had to sit on the floor near the door to get it to stay connected consistently. And something I thought I'd never say, but the hot water is too hot! There isn't any safety feature to keep it from getting to scalding...it was difficult to get it warm and then all of a sudden it was dangerous. I bought a bloodspot coupon, so this room only cost me $115, which is incredible for any establishment in Beverly Hills and I appreciate the proximity to all of the shopping, etc. But if I had paid the full price (I think $235) for this room, I'd be fuming.",Thank you for the response.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,10,"First there was no one at the front desk when I arrived. I had to get the valet to find the guy. I checked in and went to my 8 by 10 room which was so small they could not even have a chair for the desk. Hell, the tv was on the desk so there was absolutely no work area. The closet was soemthing you buy at Ikea and was not even wide enough to hold my hangers. The bathroom was 5 x 5 and there was not even enough room for my toilet bag. You would think for $199.99 a night you would get something more. The guy at the counter said this was a boutique hotel.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,20,"My husband and I stayed here using a Living Social deal. The photos on the website looked nice, but unfortunately, our tiny room was nothing like those photos. The deal was for a queen room with an upgrade upon check-in. No upgrade was available, and this was probably the smallest room I have ever seen.The bed, which was only about 5 inches off the floor, was located so close to the door that you almost smacked into it upon opening the door. There was maybe about 10 inches of space between the wall and the foot of the bed that you had to walk around to get to the rest of the room. The tiny bed was extremely uncomfortable to sleep on, and since it was so close to the door, we could hear every footstep in the hallway. No regular pillows, only 2 throw pillows on the bed.There was a small desk with a stool, which was the only place to put our bags. No place to sit down except that one stool or the bed.The bathroom was fine, nice water temp and pressure.The room appeared clean in general, except for the clump of someone else's hair found on the floor.Nice location, cute patio lounge.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,20,"I needed a place to stay in Beverly Hills since I had an early business meeting there on a Monday morning so I selected this hotel based on a recommendation from the friend of a friend. Ugghhh..When we checked in, the front desk person told us--three times--how hungover he was. Not to mention that a video was being shot in the lobby which removed any chance of us having a cocktail or sitting on the terrace.The room was tiny, dark and had ripped carpet. When we needed the car ($28 per night to valet park, FYI...) we had to wait twenty minutes for the valet.At night, the room was noisy and we were woken up by plumbing noise multiple times.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,10,"Our stay was very uncomfortable but mostly due to a bad mattress so in all fairness it may have been just the luck of the draw. We have been married for 40 years. Our stay was with the compliments of our son and daughter in law. They told us it was a boutique hotel just a couple of blocks from Rodeo and Beverly Drive and some wonderful restaurants were just around the corner. It sounded fun. We were told the hotel was 100% booked and there were no upgrades. Our room was very small which didn't bother us greatly as that can be common in upscale areas such as Paris, Tokyo, San Francisco and New York. When I asked I was told by the desk clerk the hotel was rated 3 stars. The room was more like 2 stars but the location was probably 4 stars. If you want to stay in Beverly Hills and close to Rodeo Drive it is a good bet but downsize your expectations for the room experience. Our room was probably their smallest and when I asked at the desk what the price would be for a room similar to ours I was told it was on special for $199. We did not sleep at all that night. We were not on our honeymoon and very accustomed to our own space. :) This bed brought us much closer together because the bed sloped to the middle. If someone could hear us from the hall or an adjacent room they would have thought we were on our honeymoon. The springs squeaked so loudly from the movement of our lungs expanding with normal breathing. We had a sense of humor about it when we would both wake up when one of us would roll over. Sometimes you just have to make lemonade. I have sent the manager an email. It will be interesting to hear his response. One more note. If you look at their website it states that Gregory Peck is the owner. Gregory Peck died in 1993 after a long and industrious career. I think it is time for an updated website. Keep that in mind.","Thank you for the review. We appreciate the feedback. I'm sorry to hear that the mattress was not up to your standards.

Crescent Hotel Beverly Hills,10,"The room had no furniture other than the bed and a table, there was no closet, just a small cupboard for clothes. The bed was practically on the floor and on a wooden pallet that creaked and groaned with every move you made, could also hear the the bed above creaking. While the location provides good walking access to Beverly Hills restaurants and shops, it was impossible to sleep with the noise of people talking in normal voices in the hallway, sounded like they were standing next to the bed. Was supposed to stay two nights but by 4:30AM I was on the computer looking for anything else for night number 2. I will never stay in this hotel again.","Thank you for your note.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,10,"Bad hotel in a location a few blocks from the beach, but one entire side faces the outdoor train station, with ridiculous noise from the trains and the crowds. The other sides of the hotel are teeming with homeless people and vagrants, and an overall seedy crowd. I was supposed to spend one week there and checked out after one night. There is no security at this hotel and people from the streets come in unchecked and dangerous. I literally had my life threatened for real in the elevator, and the front desk did not even file a police report. They said to me the person threatening me was a guest of a guest, and if that that happened again, they would ask that guest to pay for one night of my room. So in other words, my life had a value of a couple hundred dollars. This person who threatened me was raging how he would kill everyone in the hotel, and had other guests racing to their cars, and locking their doors, he was so threatening. I highly recommend no one ever stay at this disaster of a hotel that values a guests safety so little.","Dear garyblue99 ,Thank you for choosing to stay at the Courtyard Santa Monica and providing your honest feedback on the Guest Satisfaction Survey.Providing the highest level of hospitality is our number one priority and we sincerely apologize for falling short of meeting your expectations.Once again, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,10,"Have been a member of Marriott for over 10 years. Traveled countless hotels. Never had an issue that could not be resolved until this night. I'm not a picky traveler - if the room is clean and plumbing works - it's good for me.Arrived into Santa Monica Courtyard at 11 PM. No parking left and no valet. ""You are checking in late, so it's your problem"". Wait what? A check in before midnight in Marriott system is not a late check-in by any means. As a business traveler, the times I've been arriving to Courtyards at 1 AM or later due to late flights and other travel issues has been countless. Never been an issue. Well, all right.Walk into the room. It's smoked in. It's so heavily smoked in, cleaning crew has lef the window open to try and alleviate the smell. It's so febreezed, you can practically see Febreeze in the air. Turn around and walk down: ""I'm sorry, what's going on with the room?"" - ""Oh, you are checking in late, so we gave away your room and you get this one, this is the last room left. No, we can't do anything else for you. Want some more Febreeze or an ozone machine? We can give you a discount. Oh, and our shift is up, so sayonara, sucker"".Wow. No help with transfer to another hotel, nothing. A hapless fella with 4 weeks on the job could only void the reservation and cancel the charges. Corporate was no help: ""we'll log the case for you""Of course, you can't leave this review in Marriott system unless you stayed at Marriott.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,30,"We stayed here for 3-4 months from ~April-July of 2017 because it was the only hotel in town I could tolerate due to my sensitivities to chemicals and mold. I hope for the sake of this hotel and all its guests that the desk staff and management has been replaced or trained up since we stayed.I tried to return in 2019 and didn't do well enough in the building to stay because it had become somewhat damp, but the two desk staff members who helped me at that point seemed MUCH nicer. Maybe that was because I contacted them through the Marriott app with my Platinum elite status. I hope it was because the problems I describe below were solved!When we stayed in 2017 we didn't make a reservation because I have to check a room in person before I can know whether I can stay in it, and we didn't want to lose money for a shot in the dark reservation.The building was new and we stayed in a a few different balcony suites with the balcony open and fresh air coming in all day. That part was nice, but the building has already become a bit damp due to the ocean air.Housekeeping was great!The worst part of our experience by far was the desk staff and management. Most of them treated me like trash because I am fat and disabled and wasn't dressed/made up/bejeweled like a movie star when we landed in their hotel on a Sunday evening after a cross-country road trip. They made us pre-pay for our room because of our disheveled cross-country drive appearance.The morning after we checked in I tried to extend the reservation for the rest of the week, the desk staff outright told me I couldn't afford the room I was in, accused me of fraud, and told me I had to leave the hotel room with no warning at 11am.They would not allow me to pay for the room with my partner's credit card. He had checked in with me the night before, and we had we told them he was going to start his new job the next morning and we would extend the reservation as long as I woke up feeling good, but they did not ask for payment at either of those points. The desk person even waved at him as he left the hotel for work. They made him leave his first day of orientation at his new job to get on the phone and verify the use of his credit card - text messages and photos of his drivers license and credit card (the same one we paid for the first night with) wouldn't suffice.They told us we couldn't stay longer than the first few days because no rooms were available, so I reserved online (plenty of open rooms of course). When they saw we had reserved the room again anyways they were mad and made actual scoffing noises at us for a few days.They made housekeeping check our room because of our longer stay even though I'm allergic to their cleaning products. The housekeeping manager was embarrassed when she entered because the room was spotless from our daily wipe down of the entire room, with all our belongings in plastic weathertight bins from the Container Store. We live this way because of my extreme allergies and tried to tell the desk staff that, but they insisted we were disgusting and somehow destroying their hotel room. From that point on housekeeping was incredibly apologetic and brief during our weekly room inspections.They were surprised and angry when they saw that I was a multi-year Platinum Elite Marriott member.When they realized that my partner does in fact work in the entertainment industry as a mid-level manager for one of their biggest corporate clients, they were shocked and suddenly were much nicer to us. His employer paid them directly for our room for 3 months (and we paid for almost an additional month), which went relatively smoothly, especially compared to the fiasco that they created when we first arrived after our cross-country trip. They still kept trying to ""catch"" us not paying for the room throughout our stay because of their own disorganization in coordinating with his employer's relocation specialist who was paying them, which was quite a frustrating way to start our time in a new city.I've since had much better experiences with the Santa Monica Proper Hotel, which is a much nicer building run by absolutely top notch staff who treat everyone with the utmost respect regardless of appearances.Room tips: Balcony rooms get a great ocean breeze but overlook the train station (cigarette smoke, natural gas fumes, noise).Mold avoiders will not like the (slightly moldy) tile showers in the double queen rooms, and at least one handicapped access balcony room with a tub is bad.","Thank you for choosing to stay at the Courtyard Santa Monica and providing your honest feedback on the Guest Satisfaction Survey.Providing the highest level of hospitality is our number one priority and we sincerely apologize for falling short of meeting your expectations.Once again, thank you for taking the time to share your feedback.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,30,"I was in town on business and thought I would stay close to the beach. Hotel is within walking distance of the Pier and beaches. It's not the best part of town, but seemed fairly safe to walk around. The hotel was still in lock-down mode so none of the amenities were available. This chain offers no incentive to make up for not being able to use a pool, exercise room, or even the breakfast. I had reserved a King room, and upon arrival I was told that even though I had reserved the King, they only had a Queen room available. I was not too happy, but what do you do. So I guess it is up to the hotel what room you will get. I was told the views were better from the Queen room, and it was a very nice view into the apartment building 30 feet away. The people in the apartment looked friendly enough. I was still charged the rate for the King room. Most of the Restaurants are still closed and delivery of food takes forever. The rooms do not have microwaves, so if you want to re-heat food you have to wait in the line in the lobby. So much for Social Distancing. There is a small fridge but you need to turn it on every 2 hours. My rating would have been lower but the staff is very friendly and helpful.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,30,"My 8 year old daughter and I stayed here on a Friday night as a staging point for our Saturday flight out of LAX. The positives with the property are that it is new, relatively clean etc. The access to downtown Third Street mall and the Pier are exceptional. The staff was pleasant, and good, not necessarily great.The thing that struck me about the property is how stark and hard edged it is. I know that this design is the rage for 20 and 30 somethings. It reminds me a little bit of an Aloft design. But sound bounces around and it feels cold actually.I am not sure that we would necessarily use it for family as a first choice, and definitely would not use it for an extended stay.

I expect a high standard of operation when I stay at a Marriott Branded property.1) I tried calling twice before arriving and couldnt get through to an oerator or from desk after waiting on hold 10 min each time.2) In two nights our room wasnt cleaned. I had to call the front desk to get the bed made.3) The hallways were dirty and looked like they werent vacuumed for several days4) Our television didnt work and we were lacking towels when we checked into our room.5) The room was very noisy. I am not sure how this place was constructed but it was noisy from adjacent rooms and from the room above us.6) It was necessary to walk outside to get to our room from the elevator.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,20,"Cons: Across from the train station and noisy, hotel boasts of Ocean Views but there is no ocean view, many many buildings in the way, area is dodgy because of the train station and police have to patrol it often, the misguided ""modern"" design of the rooms is hideous.Pros: Staff was friendly.Stayed here for several nights while attending AFM. If staying in Santa Monica, definitely stay someplace else. The hotel is directly across from the Metro Link train platforms and the noise of the trains coming and going, digital bells and whistles and all is enough to keep the soundest sleeper up. If you enjoy the sight of riff raff urinating over a train platform at 8PM at night, this is the hotel for you. Paid extra for a larger ""executive suite with Ocean view,"" problem was there is no ocean view from this property. It's far back from the water and there are buildings in the way. If a microscopic fraction of an alleyway sliver counts for an ocean view then I've got a bridge in Brooklyn I want to sell you. The design of the suite itself was just plain bad. Amenities are paltry too with a ""rooftop pool"" that's small and directly across from the train platform.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,10,Robyn at the front desk called me at 2pm telling me I had 30 minutes to leave my room. I reminded her I had requested a 4pm checkout which I'm guaranteed as a Marriott Gold Elite member. She said that benefit is not guaranteed and they are sold out and need my room. I told her the website says it is guaranteed. She then told me they actually had a noise complaint which is an absolute lie. I was literally laying in bed checking emails. Had I been making noise it would have been the first thing she mentioned and not used as a way to try and get my room. They also wouldn't have offered to refund one night valet fee. Horrible way to end my stay and there is obviously no benefit to having been a loyal Marriott rewards member.,"Hello and thank you for taking the time to provide feedback. I am sorry for the experience you had while staying with us. Although this does not take away the frustration, I did want to point out a few things. As an important Gold Elite member, you mean a lot to us and Marriott. I wanted to clarify that our Gold Elite members can get up to a 2pm late check out, but this is based on availability and must be approved by the hotel. Unfortunately during our busy summer months, this can be very difficult to grant as we have many new guests coming in that want to get checked in as well. And although requested, if we had not approved this late check out, this is probably why we were trying to reach you. As a Gold Elite, you do get other benefits as well. 25% bonus points, welcome gifts, higher speed internet, upgrades based on availability, and of course 2pm late check out if available. Please feel free to reach out to me directly and I am more than happy to explain further.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,20,"I booked here for three nights leaving on the 3 August. I will say that this hotel is in an excellent location, and is clearly new/ clean. Immediately as I arrived I was very happy as I got an upgrade to a corner room. The staff were very friendly (though ineffective, see below) throughout my stay. But this place’s only real benefit is the location.With regards to the noise, believe the hype. The first night I didn’t hear anything, presumably no one was in the room above me. However, I will confirm what others have said - it sounded like a herd of elephants were upstairs the next two days. I mentioned it to the front desk and they told me there was no one in the room, so at least one episode was due to the cleaners apparently, and they sounded like they were having so much fun...And on to the cleaning. My room was not serviced one day. Not the end of the world, but I don’t ask for much in hotels, and doing the service I’ve paid for is a fairly low expectation I think... I talked to the front desk who were very apologetic, and told me they would a) credit me 250 points and b) Email the manager to request more. One of the reasons I’ve left this review until now is to allow this to happen and I’ve seen nothing. Btw - I did pay with points, and 250 is less than 1% of what I paid. Hardly ‘compensation’. I was also out of my room for 6 hours between 8 and 5, so it wasn’t not serviced because I hadn’t left (if I got those negatives right ;)Last point - I was advised I could rent a bike with the valet by the front desk. Walked 10 yards to the valet and they told me they didn’t and I should walk down the street. Not a crime to not know the services that are available, but not great either...Overall - not sure the location makes up for the adequate/ poor service, especially the noise.","Hello and thank you for taking the time to give us a review.

The staff was courteous & did their best to resolve the problems we encountered. The actual facility is lacking, however. We had a king suite. The room is large, but has almost no storage. We needed to borrow a valet cart to try to accommodate hanging clothes. Only 3 very small drawers in a dresser with a false bottom. Room is decorated in a contemporary/beach theme. Modern sofa & chair look cool, but very uncomfortable. For some reason, window washers we scheduled in the early morning on a holiday! Small balcony was a nice touch, but it looks out on the Metra station. Price quotes for our stay varied greatly from site to site- the difference was sometimes as much as $150/night.

Another downside was that you could only control the thermostat to a certain point...no air conditioning below 68 degrees. For people who sleep warm, this was a definite bummer. Housekeeping was interesting...each day we couldn’t find important items and had to search the room...eventually finding them placed in random drawers or the closet (we didn’t unpack any of our items into these places, so it was an odd thing for them to put them there.)We also chose this hotel for the queen size beds vs. the standard doubles in many hotels.

I do feel the City does a great job with assisting in those areas, but obviously we as a community fell a little short on your stay. For that I apologize. I also like to let guests know about the parking. Yes, there are several options for outside of the hotel parking. The garage you do mention, I need to add, does not have in-and-out privileges. If you plan to leave your car and not use again until you leave permanently, then this is a great option that we tell our guests. However, if you do plan to come and go, it will cost you each time. I did also want to clarify, our parking is 46.20 per night after tax.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,30,"Stayed at this new hotel for two nights while in town for business. Truly mixed feelings, here is the good and not so good:Good: New property so design is modern and you get that ""new"" smell. Location is great close to mall, restaurants and 5-minutes to beach and pier. Front desk staff were friendly and efficient as was the valet service. Also liked the pool area, second level balcony - though did not use it.Negatives: From my perspective, the biggest challenge was noise. I could hear the person next to me talking on their phone after midnight word-for-word EVEN after turning my tv up to 6 to drown him out. For some reason, the walls in this place are paper thin...made for a very frustrating and sleepless visit. This alone will keep me from returning. Otherwise, the lack of proper breakfast facility (only a Starbucks in the lobby), mandatory valet at $42/day were also negatives.Unfortunate, there is good potential here, but noise dampening and better breakfast options would make it so much better.","Hello and thank you for taking the time to fill out a survey. I appreciate your feedback. I am sorry to hear you would not return. We do offer earplugs at the front desk for any noise issues, if that helps at all. I am also sorry to hear that our options at breakfast were not to your liking. Although the menu is not large, we do feel we offer some great choices, from breakfast sandwiches to fruit, parfaits, cereal, and assorted pastries, bagels and muffins. I do understand if you are looking for the likes of pancakes, waffles and omelets, as we do not carry those types of items.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,20,"Was pretty impressed with the new look that Marriott did with the Courtyard brand. More edgy and young. However thats where it all stops. Upon check in was told that there was NO benefits for elite Gold and Platinum members, all guest ranks 'pari passu'. A most interesting piece of information.Next in the room, I desperately tried to lower the temperature in the room as it is after all summer now, but when I enquired I was informed that the temperature in all rooms are fixed at 68F as the lowest it can go! Amazing, is this a new hotel or an old one with defunk instrumentations. They offered a fan to help with the temperature control, clearly I was not the only one that had issue with this.To sum, am totally disappointed with THIS Courtyard. I do try to stay with a Marriott hotel on my travels as the service levels have been consistent, well up until now. Compare and contrast the Courtyard in Bangkok; and also my recent stay at the Marriott Union Square during this same trip; service levels have been consistent. More so, with the Marriott, which is a higher range. But it would seem the young upstart, with new colors doesn't need to acknowledge its loyal members and has kept things stuck at 68 only. Guess thats the maximum rating they are hoping to achieve, a rather tall order perhaps... Might get better treatment at the Hampton Inn which is on Colorado as well just across the road, with a really great looking pool.If not for the location, It would have just gotten a one rating. Will certainly put a note next to this one to never stay again. In fact this goes for all my future travels and the Marriott chain.","Hello Andrew, and thank you for your feedback during your stay. I was quite surprised to hear about your troubles here. This is not indicative of the level of service we provide our guests. As far as the temp, there is a range of temperature. 68 is the lowest the room will tend to get in the room and is pretty chilly to most. I am wondering if the thermostat may not have been functioning correctly. We also do provide our reward members with benefits, so I was disappointed to see you did not receive. I apologize for that.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,10,"Despite having a request in my Marriott profile for a high floor, I was given a room on the lowest floor. Not a huge deal, but this room came with the added ""bonus"" of absolutely no cell phone coverage - probably due to the concrete interior surroundings. As other reviewers have noted, it is also NOISY due to the tile floors - lots of noise from above and next door and everywhere.Front desk was unsympathetic and completely unresponsive to my request for a different room. If they treat a platinum rewards member this way, I can only imagine what others might encounter. Definitely not worth the exorbitant nightly rate they charge. Highly recommend you stay somewhere else.","Hello Ophelia,I am sorry for the unsatisfactory stay you had. I can assure you we try to accommodate our guest's requests as much as we can. I can only assume that perhaps we were sold out and did not have any options at that time. I am very sorry that we could not accommodate you.

Courtyard by Marriott Santa Monica,30,"I hate to write reviews like this but I feel that Marriott has done its customers a disservice. The hotel is new and thus clean. The room was nicely appointed, lots of space and plugins, etc. The service was good also.What's my beef? First the hotel has a noise issue. Too bad because I like the room, but I can hear the upstairs guests every footstep. Also, the Marriott site lists the hotel as having a ""restaurant"" on site. This is just misleading advertising. There is a small cafe with a very limited menu and limited hours. Not much made to order except the Starbucks coffee. This is not a Starbucks either. So you have to walk two blocks to McDonalds or fourth blocks to a Denny's. There is plenty of lunch/dinner choices within a 15 min walk, but breakfast is another matter. There is a local place several blocks away but this hotel does not seem to cater to business clientele, with the food situation, IMO. As expensive as it is to stay here, this is really a disappointment.It's not a terrible hotel, just average. Too bad . . . Marriotts are generally above average.","Hello Jeff and thank you for choosing our hotel to stay at in Santa Monica. I am sorry of the noise issues you had during your stay.

Must be that the maid walks in there with her dirty disgusting shoes - to clean the shower walls. Looked like a mess and was disgusting!House-keeping is the weak link in the chain at this mediocre hotel.A/C unit throttles off at night so you can be assured you will be hot while sleeping and NOT get a good nights sleep - all so they can save on money by throttling down the AC at night.Also no trash-can liners - which is disgusting. Why to hotels save pennies by eliminating trash-can liners? Pathetic!No complimentary breakfast nor coffee here - everything at a Courtyard is ala-carte.

Inn at Venice Beach,30,"I booked the Inn at Venice Beach based on location and TripAdvisor reviews. I find it very hard to believe that it is rated #10 out of 348 hotels in L.A. It certainly was adequate, with modern decor, decent-sized room (I had a deluxe king room), but nothing out of the ordinary and certainly not a luxury hotel. Bathroom was small but fine for one person. The fridge was very welcome, as was the in-wall safe. Breakfast was European-style, featuring bagels, muffins, yogurt, and such, and was a nice addition. Staff were very friendly and helpful. But the facility shows its age in some areas: a slow, lumbering elevator, and rust spots viewable from the courtyard where apparently air conditioning units dripped water. LA is expensive, and this hotel was too. The added fee for parking was an annoyance; it should be included in the rate. For a fairly expensive room, I was unpleasantly surprised that the cups provided were thin plastic ones wrapped in cellophane, a la a one-star hotel. I suggest to hotel management that they upgrade to glass -- or at minimum heavy plastic cups that can be washed or recycled.","Dear Athena222,Thank you for taking the time to comment and share your experience with others.

Inn at Venice Beach,20,"The room was spacious, clean, and the staff was very courteous. Plus they have cookies. The location is superb. And if it weren't for the following problem I would give it a four star rating. However, there is a preauthorization on my credit card that I did not authorize from this hotel. I stayed there one night and I have two charges. When I call the staff I'm advised that they don't see this extra charge on their end. So I emailed them a screenshot of the preauthorization to ""prove"" what I am saying, and all they can offer is that they don't see it on their end. I'm advised to contact my bank, who advises me to contact the Inn at Venice Beach. I suppose I will have to wait to see if this extra charge of $267.38 goes through as a charge on my card or not.

Inn at Venice Beach,30,"This hotel is pricey even considering LA and being just a few blocks from Venice beach. Nothing ""wrong"" with the room per se (although the two bed side table lamp bulbs didn't work, and the shower was a little lacking pressure), but the biggest thing that bothered me was the relatively insecure door lock (though I didn't have a problem) it just was a little creepy as it seemed there was quite a gap between the door and the doorjamb, and there was no deadbolt just the lock in the door knob.

Inn at Venice Beach,30,"I'm a little confused at how this hotel got such great ratings. Maybe we had an off experience? We stayed in Venice for two nights, one before and one after a wedding nearby. The first night was at a different hotel, similar price, that was SO lovely. The last night was at Inn at Venice beach.We had a King room on the first floor and you could hear every car that drove by like it was in the room, I could hear the conversations of people who walked by, the wheels of the skateboards, etc. I'm not super noise sensitive normally but felt like this was exceptional. I could also hear banging on the walls from the interior and the shower/water of the room above us. The other place we stayed at had a water view, private patio, free bottles of water (you have to pay at Inn at Venice beach), similar space/style, rooftop deck, was very quiet, and the list goes on.

Our experience did not get off to a very good start as the room we were allocated on the second floor smelt of cigarettes. Luckily we were moved however whilst the new room smelt better, the noise was so bad from creaking floorboards and the water system we did not sleep at all well. The next day we asked if we could move to the third floor and I can honestly say the rooms are so much better, sure there was some street noise but nothing like what we experienced on the second floor.

From the lobby to the room we glanced at each other, knowing this wasn't going to be the brief vacation spot we had anticipated. Here are the good things: It is clean. There is a Keurig coffee maker (with one regular coffee pod). The balcony door opens to let in a breeze. The two staff members we met are very nice. The shampoo/soaps/etc. are terrific. The bad: It's very noisy, particularly at night, but that's expected for the area. The decor makes an attempt at something but it misses the mark. It feels tired. The room is small. The bathroom tiny. Our toilet didn't work properly. The room smelled musty. It all made me wish I owned the place and could paint and replace the bedspread and furniture and have a kick-butt little boutique hotel within walking distance to the beach.

Inn at Venice Beach,30,"Covered parking for my convertible, great service at check-in and able to get in early. Location is (2) blocks off the beach with several restaurants nearby, great location. The two of us stayed one night in a third floor room with a loft. Modern decor with recent remodel, flat screen tv's and comfortable beds. Small kitchenette and balcony with a view were nice surprises. However, upon entry the room was stuffy and warm. The AC cooled the lower level quite nicely but the loft was never really comfortable until very late in the evening. Unfortunately, that proved to be the perfect recipe for bed bugs.

Inn at Venice Beach,10,"The room was ok; clean enough and spacious. It goes downhill from there.The layout of the hotel is terrible (half inside/half outside centering around a strange courtyard that no one was ever in. It made absolutely no sense, three floors of confusion.)To say that the staff was inattentive would be a massive understatement.No one ever told us that there was breakfast until the last day, though when we saw what it was; cold cereal and a bucket of hard boiled eggs, it was probably for the best.The staff were each as unhelpful as possible and they made us sign so many pieces of paper that it felt like we were applying for a bank loan.Not worth staying unless your life depends on it. Definitely skip it.Silver lining: There are slinky's in every room. Literally.","Thank you for taking the time to comment. I am pleased to know that you found our rooms clean and spacious. I’m sorry to hear that you did not like the layout of our hotel. Most of our guests really enjoy our courtyard; in fact, it is the #1 request in terms of room location. Our Complimentary Breakfast is also well received by others and people rave about the many options such as fresh fruit, yogurt, bagels, cereals, pastries, boiled eggs, teas, and coffee from Coffee Bean and Tea Leaf . Thank you for bringing to my attention that it was not mentioned by our staff at check-in, as it is very important to me that our guests are all informed of the variety of free amenities we offer.

Inn at Venice Beach,30,"The Inn at Venice Beach is a complete mixed bag. A bit Jekyll and Hyde. Firstly, the location two blocks from the beach is great and a nice stroll from the hotel. The hotel is clearly an oldie that has been done up. The internals are quite nice and have a boutique feel to them, nice colours, furnishings so it gets plusses here. Despite asking for a quiet, elevated room we were allocated level 1 overlooking a six lane road, this was disappointing, and despite requests a fairly carefree front counter lady was very unhelpful and unable to offer an alternate. Furthermore, directions to a nearby laundry for washing ended up on a wild goose chase which was just annoying. The air con was a bit over the shop, the place was loud and our toilet overflowed...so this place would hardly come with a glowing endorsement. Despite this the bed is comfy and our checkout was helpful. It's hard to rate this one, it falls somewhere between a 1 and a 4, so I will say 2.5 stars...","Dear Valued Guest,Thank you for taking the time to comment on your stay!

Inn at Venice Beach,10,"First, the good: The hotel is clean and in a great location, just off Washington Square in Venice Beach.ow, the bad: We made our reservation through Southwest Airline's website in a package deal with our plane tickets. Weekend rates were slightly higher than weekday rates, as was expected, but the overall price was good. When we checked in we were told that we'd already paid (though the charge hadn't shown up on our credit card statement). Upon checkout, we asked for a receipt and were refused. Specifically we were told that since they'd already charged us (they hadn't), we didn't need to sign off on the charges, so a receipt wouldn't be provided. Uh okay... Then the charge shows up on our card, much higher than the rate we agreed to when making our reservation. After speaking with the manager on the phone, we were told that because the reservation was made with a third party (not an Inn staff member over the phone), the rates could change without notice and a refund would not be issued. We again asked for an itemized receipt and was given the run around. When the manager finally agreed to provide a receipt, he made it difficult. We had to receive a faxed form, fill it out, and fax it back just to have him snail mail a receipt (or so he said...we've yet to receive it).The other issue was that the Inn was under construction. To be fair, we knew this was happening as it was mentioned in our reservation confirmation. However, it was stated on that confirmation (and posted all over the Inn) that the construction would be confined to 9am-5pm Monday through Friday. This was not the case at all! Construction noise could be heard at all hours on all days that we were staying there (Thursday-Sunday). Additionally, the water was turned off not only during the posted construction times, but on Saturday as well. When we mentioned this to the manager while discussing the room rate increase, he stated that he knew for a fact the water was not off on Saturday during our stay. After arguing, he finally said he'd take $30 off the bill after discussing the water situation with his construction crew.All in all, we weren't in the room much during our trip. When we were, it was a constant source of irritation. We won't stay here again because of the poor customer service.","I really appreciate your taking the time to share your disappointment with your recent stay.

We found the staff to be incredibly welcoming and helpful. 2 caveats though i) if you are looking for a romantic gateway, Venice Beach might not be the best venue overall. Although it is walking distance (30 min) to Santa Monica, it is not as hip and romantic. It is more geared towards street-ball, tattoo shops and street vendors. A very eclectic area but not a romantic gateway. ii) throughout our stay, there has been weird noises coming from our sink. not horrible, but can wake you up at night.","Thank you for taking the time to share such great feedback about your recent stay in May.

We were hoping it would be a little more like an ""inn"" than a generic place but while we had no major problems with the place, it was just about as generic as staying at any of the mid-range chains. Our room was an okay size and very clean. There was a tiny balcony overlooking a side street which was fine. The bathroom was very small but clean. Our sink did make some odd noises at various times when it wasn't even in use. We told them about this at check-out, so hopefully it will be fixed.They offer a continental breakfast which was almost exactly what you'd find at any of the chains.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,20,"The charge $45 per day to park, not advertised on Expedia website. Seems an obscene amount to park. Santa Monica has a challenging homeless issue.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,10,"We booked this over priced one night stay at the end of our 5 day trip to be closer to LAX for an early morning departure. Being a Club Wyndham Owner and participate in Wyndham Rewards, normally a one night is 15k points but I assume due to the location we used double the points for the night. Location is great but our room was an adjoining room so it sounded like the guests next door were in our room. I guess the TV is located near the adjoining door since we could hear it very clearly in our room. Also, we stayed on the 7th floor with the windows facing California Interstate 1 and their windows are not sealed properly or are not noise canceling. We could hear all the traffic in our room. At one point I thought the windows were open. Also, nightly parking after taxes is around $47. I did not check hotel prices around to compare because we used our points but I would definitely suggest doing so. I let the front desk attendant know about the noise and he stated no one had complained before about the traffic noise but after reading some reviews, it’s obvious they have had other complaints.","Thank you for your feedback. I am sorry to hear that you did not enjoy your stay with us.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,30,"You are paying for the location of this hotel. We wanted to spend a few days by the beach to finish off our USA trip (we're from Australia) which was why we choose this hotel. The rooms are average, they could do with a refurb however we were extremely disappointed on the first night when our daughter went to sleep on the fold out couch, the mattress was just springs there was no cushioning or comfort, even my husband said that it was worse than beds in the military. We rang housekeeping who brought up some doona's to try to make it more comfy and expressed that it was of unacceptable quality for anyone & that she should pass on our feedback to management, she advised that she was aware of the quality due to other complaints......Wow and it hasn't been replaced/upgrade, very poor service. Our daughter had an ok sleep however as we were staying 3 more nights we insisted that we get an alternative, thankfully they were able to provide an alternative, much better quality mattress. I hope that the original mattress has since been destroyed and that no other guests should be subjected to such poor, unacceptable quality.On a positive the rest of our stay was problem free, special thank you to Natalie who arranged extra late check out for us (we paid for late check out however were complimented an additional 2 hours).The hotel is in a great location however l don't know if the price is justified. I would probably seek an alternative hotel unless it undergoes a refurb to further justify the price.","Greetings Carly,We really appreciate you giving such a detailed review on your recent stay.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,30,"The location is perfect! Right in the mix of things, easy access to pier, beaches shopping, etc. One of two elevators was down our entire trip, which was fine as we were on a lower floor. Girls complained the pool area was super noisy. Room was next to freeway, so there's road noise, which isn't too much of an issue for me as I wear earplugs. The room was smaller, and no fridge, but overall it was okay. The bathroom was tiny. If you have more than 2 people in a room it will be cramped. The shower doesn't have a door and water gets everywhere (no tub); so much so that the bottom of the bathroom door has the paint flaking off and rust. I expect some of this being next to the ocean, but we all had issues with the shower. In general I think I would rather stay a little further away from the ocean part and get a nice place. Ubers are cheap and quick, and we did so much walking anyways it wouldn't have been an inconvenience. Parking is always extra at any downtown hotel, so be prepared.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,10,"First, I want to say I made a mistake, I should have never booked a room here. After traveling across country from Florida in our VW Bug and finishing our Route 66 trip, I thought I would spurge a little at the end of the road. Traveling with a dog is difficult, but the Wyndham chain is pet friendly, sort of. We have stayed with them every night except one and have reservations going back to Florida with them.So my mistake is seeing microwaves and refrigerators listed on there site and assuming they had them in every room like the Travelodge and LaQuinta (also owned by Wyndham) We needed these for medication. But when we checked in and asked we were told we needed to request them and they were limited and not available. So I asked to use a microwave to heat her medications once at night and one in the morning.I got into a big argument with a manager about using any microwave in the building and that is when I first heard the ""no"" word and ""we can't do that"". Before it got physical, a security guard stepped in and took me to the kitchen and took care of me. Sadly before I could get it back to the room it had cooled down and she wouldn't take it. One night without medication isn't going to kill her, but it isn't good.The next morning, I took her medication and her to the lobby. I talked to about 4 different staff members that all told me they couldn't do it even when I told them this wasn't my first rodeo. I finally got someone in the kitchen to put it on a plate and heat it for 8 seconds. I was able to get her to take her medication without any issues.What about the rest of the hotel? The room is nice and the view of McDonald's is amazing if you are into that sort of thing. The LaQuinta in Slidell, LA was nicer all around. Except fpr the missing microwave the room is ok. The view is not worth the cost, but it is close to the Pier and there is a park within a block for walking our dog.So if you are into being told No, this is the place for you. I will not be back and I am going to stop using Wyndham completely and give up my Rewards.","Greetings nb_mitch,Thank you for this review, we're sorry to hear about the troubles you experienced.

Breakfast overpriced. We opted for McDonald’s across the street.The bathroom lighting was dim, as in many hotels, with no exhaust fan. The bathroom was warm and muggy after one showered. The door could not be left fully opened during a shower because of the small floor space in the room.

Even small bottle of water at room costed 8 dollars. They charged about 50 dollars depozit per each day in case you damage the room. They charged everything in advance and when hotel stopped function because of some emergency they evacuated us to the street and left 3 hours during night in reception and send guests to LA airport hotel, we were lucky to be placed in another nearby hotel though. But till now they I hace not recieved back any money which they charged in advance even depozits. It was a very sad experience for me. Santa Monica is just a small town with one main street with shops and overpriced restaurants and empty beach.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,20,"This hotel is one of the ""cheaper"" hotels in the area, but it's still way too expensive for what you get. I regret not staying somewhere cheaper (because this place was on par with those places but for more money) or nicer and more expensive. The hotel is also hard to get to- traffic in this area is crazy and there are tons of pedestrians. It took us 15 minutes to go .2 miles near the hotel. The ""partial ocean view rooms"" are hilarious- they cost more and you have a tiny sliver of ocean through an extremely dirty window. What you really see is the McDonalds across the street with a lot of homeless people congregated outside of it and rooftops. Being on this side of the hotel is also loud- there was loud music with an intense bass going late into the evening on the weekend we were there. The location is close to the promenade and Santa Monica place- but it's overrun with people and crowds going to the pier. The rooms were nothing special, and the bathrooms were below average. This has the potential to be a good value hotel, but I wouldn't stay here again unless the prices were lowered.Lastly, a $43 parking fee when the rooms are already extremely overpriced is just crazy.","Thank you for the candid review MS!

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,20,"My partner and I had just finished a trip before he went to a business event and I flew home. Our friend who was also attending was staying as were others from same event. We shared a room with our friend that night so we could all spend that evening together. We booked well in advance and it was always three people. Given the high rate of the room, we didn’t expect two tiny double beds. Not even queens. We called the desk straight away and there were no solutions. In the end my partner and I simply could not sleep in the bed comfortably- and we are not big people. He ended up sleeping on the floor. The room was also hot and the fan so loud we had to turn it off to sleep and just fry. The parking fee is also extortionate, I guess because it is a captive market. I felt sorry for the valet having to explain it and then he couldn’t give us any advice on parking rates nearby. I get that is competition, but come on, I’m sure you guys are doing just fine without robbing on the parking too. We were looking forward to this as a great end to the holiday. It really wasn’t.

It is not the normal fridge that we are use to at Wyndham’s.Due to the cost of parking we simply parked our car across the street at the large parking structure and it was half the price.It is a very busy area. The mall and outdoor promenade nearby is fantastic. The pier is interesting. Be cognizant that the area is heavily utilized by the homeless so if you leave something out, unattended it will not last long. We were constantly bothered to give change.

Three of us were staying in the room and the beds wouldn't have comfortably fitted two unless you were a couple that wanted to sleep close together.

We noticed an option for a fridge which once we asked for it was delivered within 30 minutes at no charge.We only had breakfast once in the Hotel and it was ok except the orange juice was undrinkable & the waitress failed to understand or act on our complaint so we reported the matter on check out & the bill was removed from our tally. There is no restaurant only the Bar Area where breakfast is served, so from our overall experience would not recommend, better to go out for breakfast.On balance we enjoyed our stay here and Santa Monica itself as The Pier seems to be the centre of everything and we were so close.","Thank you for sharing such a thorough review of your stay!

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,10,"Pluses:+ Bed and pillows were comfortable+ Shower water pressure was good+ Location is nice, but cab/Uber/Lyft drivers seem to have problems finding it.Minuses:Key card system is out-dated and barely functional. I had to insert my key into the elevator at least five times to get it to read every time I tried to get upstairs to my room — this happened with a replacement key as well.The external windows are so dirty that I did not need privacy curtains — no one could possibly have seen through the muck anyway.Breakfast service is essentially non-existent. One morning, I sat in the breakfast area for ten minutes without a single staff person in sight. I ended up leaving without ordering anything to catch a flight.The toilet flush is so aggressive that you are guaranteed to wake a partner if you have one in the room.The windows and walls are thin enough to hear your neighbors and street performers in the promenade outsideThe HVAC in the room rattles incessantly in an uneven patternFitness area is anemic","Greetings Keaton,Please accept our apologies.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,30,"Stayed here for 2 nights over the weekend. Used 15,000 Wyndham points per night which was an amazing value, given that Summer weekend nights were about $500 all-in per night. I will say, if you're looking to stay near the beach, pier, and restaurants/bars, the hotel has amazing location. It's one block from the pier and beach, and right next to a lot of shops, restaurants, and bars. To me, that's where it all ends. The price per night if paying is ridiculous, as this hotel is average at best. The rooms aren't that old, but they definitely aren't new. There are homeless all over the place outside the hotel, though to me that's a Santa Monica problem, not a Wyndham problem. Nevertheless, my wife hated walking around Santa Monica because of it. Our room, while it did overlook the ocean a little, also overlooked the highway and the park next to the highway which is full of homeless people. The pool was ok and would have been quite nice, if it weren't right next to the highway - it was very noisy, and you really had to just try and ignore the noise. The lobby looked modern and had a nice bar, but it was small. Parking is very expensive (I think $42/night or something like that), but since we just needed somewhere to leave our car for 2 days, I found somewhere .5 miles away on a parking app for only $20 for the 2 days. All-in-all the value for us was great, but I can't imagine I'd ever return, and if paying for the rooms, definitely look elsewhere.","Greetings Yoshapman,Thank you kindly for the detailed review, we welcome and appreciate all feedback. We do hope you will reconsider returning in the future, utilizing your Wyndham Rewards points was certainly a bargain, however our rates fluctuate quite often, so you may certainly find a great deal by checking our website directly online.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,30,"The hotel is just down the road from the pier and across the road from downtown Santa Monica - so it is a great location to explore SM, the beaches and LA beyond.For the price it is decidedly average - more mid-level motel quality than you would expect. The rooms are ok - they are clean and decently sized but lacking any inspiration. The air conditioning units in them are ancient and very, very noisy.While we stayed there the battery on our room safe expired so I couldn't lock the safe on one day. On checking out we realised an envelope with a few hundred dollars had been taken during this time so look after your valuables.A major problem for this hotel is that the street directly outside is a popular place for the homeless to gather and get quite noisy overnight. So you might be better with a room on the back but then you get the freeway noise instead. Ask for as high a floor as possible for minimum noise - my family slept soundly but I am a light sleeper so was disturbed a few times with shouting from the street. Even without the noise it's not a pleasant place to walk during the night.The pool is useless unless you want to swim right next to the freeway. Use the beach instead.","Greetings Dr. Marc,We apologize for the issues you experienced, however this is the first we are hearing about a missing envelope.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,30,"Family of 4 stayed here in August for 4 nights which was enough.Friendly staff on checkin and an okay sized room if a little dated but the beds are only doubles so far too small to make the nights comfortable, other hotels in the US have king size or queen size.The windows on the outside could do with a clean though as when you’re looking out it was like looking through a misty fog, which is a shame when the view could potentially be so nice.The pool is a little small and as others have described is at the rear of the hotel which you have to go through the car park and it has the freeway running past, but you do have the beautiful ocean right across the street to make up for it.The parking is very over priced $46 per day but for a little tip you can park over the street in a multi storey car park for $20 which is fine as long as when you return press the lost ticket button to pay the $20 max charge otherwise you will pay more..On the whole the hotel is ok, clean, great location for everything, The Santa Monica Pier 2 minute walk right out side the hotel with the beach and 3rd street promenade and shops also 5 minutes away but be warned there is a lot of homeless people very near the hotel, over the street at McDonalds and some sleep on the street outside, the police did move some on whilst we were there but they return, there is nothing wrong with the homeless, they don’t beg or hassle you for money but it just mades us all feel uncomfortable, whilst we where having a lovely time and while so many were on hard times.There is a lot of homeless people in Santa Monica and neighbouring Venice beach and on the beach front walks, which we were advised to not go into Venice at night in day was absolutely fine, also throughout Santa Monica and Venice due to the legalised cannabis laws you can smell cannabis pretty much all the time whilst you walk around the beach front areas and roads, which isn’t great when you’re with the kids.",Thank you Ian for sharing such candid feedback about your experience in Santa Monica.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,30,"A good location close to the beach though sat navs seemed to find it hard to find! Unfortunately the room overlooked a noisy freeway. The room was pretty compact but clean, however the bathroom was miniscule and not well set up. It was impossible not to get the floor soaking whilst showering as was evidenced by the slowly decintigrating door. If you are of larger stature you will really struggle with the proportions of the bathroom. A fridge was brought along as we were there more than one night which we appreciated. Why can American hotels not provide mugs in their rooms for the coffee machines? The pool was a decent size with some nice furniture but no towels. Somewhat spoilt by the fact that it was built alongside the aforementioned freeway so not exactly peaceful to swim! Also the pool was in a section surrounded by really high walls so you would have to timeit really well to sunbathe there. Finally absolutely exorbitant parking...only option was valet and $47 was just a rip off.","JDC272,It's very nice of you to share your detailed experience with us.

Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier,20,"Well, where do I begin? Ahh, yes - with ""Anthony""! Upon entering and approaching the front desk, we were tepidly greeted by ""Anthony"" and while attempting to check us in he stops to answer an internal phone call during which time his coworker ""Melvin"" gives away the last available room to another guest. Granted, we were there before the 3pm check-in time but instead of placing the internal call on hold we were made to leave our luggage after flying 6 hrs and 3,000 miles and told to ""get something to eat over at Blue Plate Taco"" for the next 2hrs. Blue Plate Taco was a great suggestion but that's a story for another review.We return 2hrs later and ""Melvin"" who was nice enough, checks us in but unfortunately we had to ask to change rooms since we were given a dark room facing the freeway with barely any partial view of the ocean like we had reserved. One call to Melvin and he was nice enough to move us to a closer room immediately. Only downer was that we had to wait for the fridge we requested upon check-in but 3 calls, 2 front desk visits and 3 hours later - we had our fridge, Yay! At 6pm housekeeper ""Estella"" brings in the fridge on a dolly. We felt bad they made her haul that up. A male housekeeping staff member should've came with her to help.Anyhoo... the location was great, steps from the pier and restaurants, nice lobby with small bar but expensive daily breakfast. Lobby has no security that we saw, day or night. Anyone can enter lobby, access elevators and probably floors as room key isn't always necessary to work elevators. Lobby restrooms are open to the public, just ask for key at front desk, which makes having a key pointless. However, rooms were always cleaned promptly, cleaned well and you could bounce a quarter off the bed! Crisp and clean daily. Mattresses were pretty good.Our super efficient housekeeper/room attendant ""Delmy"" was the sweetest! She was one of only two staff members who greeted us upon entering or leaving the hotel the whole week we were there. The other was a very nice parking attendant named ""Samson"". He was always so polite and greeted guests with a smile on his face. Others just glanced then looked away. I've been to other hotels where staff at least say ""Hello"" or ""Good evening"", ""Good morning"", something, anything to guests. Not here.The icing on this whole thing was when on Fri, July 6, two days before we left, ""Anthony"" (you remember him, don't you?) saw us in the lobby (after being off a few days) and comes over to our friends and says ""Omg! You're STILL here??"" Then comes over to me personally and says ""and you're STILL here TOO?!"" Now, I don't know if that's the way paying guests are greeted these days but I would think that what Anthony should've said was ""Hello! Are you enjoying your stay with us?"" not ""You're still here?!""Anthony, our stay wasn't free, dear! And for what we were paying per night, you should've been THRILLED to see us ""STILL"" there!So a word to the wise, You can visit the Wyndham Santa Monica at the Pier but DON'T stay more than a few days - Or else you WILL be questioned!",Thank you for your feedback.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,10,"Shuttle driver Frank (that's the name he told me) was racist, sexist, overall offensive, most uncomfortable and awkward shuttle ride I have ever had. I took a shuttle from the hotel to the airport on Oct. 8, 2020 around 1:50pm. As I board Frank wouldn't let me on, I figured it wasn't time yet, he makes a joke and says I can't get on because ""where's the rest of your luggage"" I told him I travel light and my backpack is all I have. He says ""you're a girl you're supposed to have all this make up and tons of bags"", I was off put but his judgement already but I brushed it off as some awkward joke. As I board the shuttle Frank goes ""you're right you don't need make up you're very beautiful"", as much as he meant it as a compliment it was just random and I started to feel very uncomfortable. I was the only one on the shuttle and decided to sit all the way at the back hoping he wouldn't speak to me. Frank starts yelling to me now about my race. ""So are you Fillipino?"". I tell him no. Frank asks me ""so what kind of Asian are you then?"". It's very offensive to ask someone of their race ""what kind are you"" like you're some exotic animal. I feel so uncomfortable as the time passes but still answer because I feel trapped in the shuttle with him. I tell him I'm Cantonese, he says ""that's why you're so pretty"". Very creepy advances at me. Later he comments on how I look 14 years old (I'm 27) and ""how are you so skinny for an Asian? You must be a dancer, you must eat lots of Chinese food"". More awkward personal questions come and he asks me who I'm voting for in the presidential election, I tell him Joe and Frank goes ""Joe?! You're going to vote for Joe? REALLY?!"". I would stop replying to him because I felt so uncomfortable, judged, targeted yet when I wouldn't talk Frank would find some commentary that was offensive. When I was near my departure gate I told him I was flying Spirit to save on airfare and Frank makes a sexist comment about ""why don't you just be a flight attendant"".Please train your staff on how to be more appropriate and respectful with guests, especially females of color. I have never felt so uncomfortable and preyed upon from beginning to end on a 10 minute shuttle ride before.","Hello JessCT557,Thank you for posting a review about our hotel and the shuttle experience you encountered.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,20,The hotel is hopelessly outdated. The room had mattresses that were worn out and hopelessly curved in the middle. Two light bulbs were burned out of the four the illuminated the room. Ugly old carpet and furniture coverings seemed to be clean. The bathroom was generally very clean and brightly lighted.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,20,"As a Bonvoy Titanium Elite, there are some expectations within the Marriott/Bonvoy brand. The Four Points Sheraton seemingly is 4 points out of 10. The rooms leave a lot to be desired. Received a package and they charged $3 as a handling fee. WTF? I have never been charged a fee at any of the Marriott brands or SPG brands previously. If this were a Four Seasons, I could understand, but even Four Seasons does not charge. Unfortunately, I am day 1 into a 7 day stay here. May move across the street to a Marriott. So disappointing for a Bonvoy branded hotel. Will not stay here again. I am at a workshop for business being held in this awful hotel. If future workshops by the company will be held here, I will stay at the Marriott across the street or the Residence Inn a half block away the next time.The room, a junior suite, since they have no one bedroom suites, are in dire need of renovating. There are no additional electrical outlets for computers or phone charging. The bathroom door barely opens to allow you to leave it open to use the bathroom or shower to allow for ventilation.The one saving grace...the employees are all super nice and respectful...well other than the concierge that charged me for receiving a package here.","Thank you for taking the time to complete the Guest Satisfaction Survey in regards to your recent stay at the Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport.As we pride ourselves on delivering a memorable hotel experience during your travels, we have unfortunately fallen short of our goal during your recent stay.

We had a pre-payed room. They still locked the costs for a full room on my card for a week (on top of the deposit!) until I asked to finally release the money. This took 2 phone calls.2. We stayed for one night which would have cost 35$ for parking. They charged me double.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,30,Pro: The staff was very kind and professional.

There’s a nice restaurant and bar downstairs.Con: The hotel rooms could use a few upgrades. Carpets seemed old and a little outdated. The bathroom in my Delux King Suite(which the wonderful staff upgraded me to) was super small and oddly placed. I don’t think they have air conditioning..There’s a thermostat that you can control and you get coldish air . It’s more of a fan ...But the good thing is your window partially opens so you can get fresh air and a breeze. Parking is $35 a night!!!! Ouch! Also the lot isn’t all that big.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,10,"I now know why there was a deal on this hotel. This is was the worst hotel I have ever stayed in. Be prepared to wait everywhere in this building. There is valet parking available which we waited in line for when I finally got to the front of the line, rude nasty guy working the valet just hands me a 15 minuet ticket for valet, I explained I wanted to park over night “well then you have to go do it yourself” was the explanation I got told. It’s also 35$ dollars to park there no matter if you are a guest at the hotel or someone off the street. Fantastic. There was a motorcycle convention going on when we stayed, 100+ people, so tons of bikes. We had to wait in line to check in to the hotel for over 45 minuets and the line just kept getting longer and longer as we waited to check in. (Picture I posted with review of line) Keep in mind they had 4 people working at the desk to check people in and it still took this long. I actually watched the manager fill the candy bowl at the desk instead of help people check in, littearly mind blowing. When we finally approached the desk we had booked a suite with a pull out, we asked if it for sure had this pull out bed, guy at the desk just said well maybe there is I don’t know. So we asked for a roll away cot just Incase which he said would be up your room momentarily (1.5 hours later in actuality). Room was sub par at best, cleanliness was okay nothing great. Room looked like it hadn’t been used in months, just dust collecting in areas. Air conditioner was broken so we had to call down to the desk and wait again for someone to come by and fix it (another hour). Finally after a long flight, long check in, long wait to finally get comfortable, we try to go to bed and sleep but nope, the bikes start up outside for literal hours on end keep us up, until we passed out from pure exhaustion. Save your sanity and just book another hotel.","Hello, I am the Assistant Front Office Manager at the Four Points by Sheraton LAX.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,20,"My review actually surprises me, as I had stayed in this hotel twice previously this year and my experiences had been good. However, on this occasion had a room in the West Wing for the first time - it was awful. Who wants a window opening on to the corridor. We were 3 adults and 2 small children. They provided 'one' bottle of water, and one cup for coffee. The aircon did not work. I mentioned this at reception before going out for dinner. When we returned, some more bottled water had been provided but still one coffee cup and the aircon still did not work. However, it was late and we were all tired and did not relish the idea of someone trying to fix the aircon while we were trying to get children to sleep. I never had a bad experience with Starwood before the Marriott takeover. Perhaps they should take note. I will probably stay with Marriott based on my past Starwood experiences but not this hotel again","Thank you for choosing to stay at the Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport and providing your honest feedback on the Guest Satisfaction Survey.Providing the highest level of hospitality is our number one priority and we sincerely apologize for falling short of meeting your expectations.

Hotel looks good from outside and in the foyer too, however it quickly appears dated one you get in the elevator and go to your room. I was staying on the 4th floor in a room overlooking the main entrance and Airport Blvd. whilst the room is big, the furniture is dated from the 90s, and the windows have no double glazing for noise reduction. In fact a price of foam between the windows was all it had!! Therefore traffic noise was a real problem for me. One other room point, the bathroom was very small.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,30,"I travel a lot for work and stay in a lot of different hotels. For this brand, the location and the cost, I was very surprised and disappointed that they didn't have a refrigerator or microwave in the room. Motel 6 has a microwave and refrigerator in their rooms! Not only that they've been working on repairing a couple of the elevators for over a year now. We have an annual event at this property and last year the elevator was being repaired leaving only ONE elevator working on one side of this huge hotel, so you're waiting 5-10 minutes for an elevator to arrive. And we just had the event again and the elevators still aren't repaired so it was again a waiting game for an elevator on that same side. Not cool. With all the money they're saving not having microwaves and refrigerators in the rooms, I'm not sure of what's taking so long to repair the elevator. Parking is also difficult at this property and the exit gate doesn't work often so you have to blow your horn to get assistance from the valet attendants to get out of the gate. To be located right in the middle of the airport, I find this property should be doing better than it is for the location and the cost.","Hello, I am the Assistant Front Office Manager at the Four Points by Sheraton LAX.We would like to thank you for the effort and time you take in sharing your comments surrounding your experience at our property the Four Points by Sheraton LAX.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,20,"We stayed for one night, actually about 7 hours on Feb 6 - 7. While this hotel is close to LAX (we had an extended layover) that is about the only good thing we found during our stay. The hallway was noisy due to the building design. Parking was poor - old and tight lot with security not working the night we were there - anyone could enter and leave the parking lot without requiring a room key or other form of control. The shower in our room did not work - the knob you pull up to get the water to flow from the shower head would not stay up. We woke up at 4:30 AM to leave the hotel by 5:30 AM in order to get to LAX for an early flight. By the time we realized the non-functional shower there was no time to move to another room or do anything. We had booked the room thru Priceline and since we did not lodge a formal written complaint with the manager (we didn't have the time), there was no recourse that the hotel nor Priceline would provide us. Check to make sure your plumbing functions properly when you check in! There was evidence of previous repair attempts but we never checked before the early morning as we were tired and just needed sleep and a shower for our stay. Very disappointed.","Greetings,I really appreciate you taking the time to let us know how your stay went. Needless to say I was extremely disappointed to see that things didn’t go that well.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,30,"Came here for a night. Quick ride to airport. Nice staff at check-in and bar. Room had comfortable bed 😴 and despite being near airport, slept fine. I requested a quieter room. The room was cold however, and I couldn't get the heater to blow out warm air. There also wasn't a central light in the room, which meant lamp-only light--not the smoothest when arriving in room or checking out. Overall decent, efficient, and double up the blankets.","I really appreciate you taking the time to let us know how your stay went.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,30,"We stayed only one night and it was really just to sleep. Check-in was smooth. We had a nice quiet room, not a lot of noise in the halls or from other rooms. Of course, this is at the airport so you will hear airplanes landing and taking off, but even that wasn't too bad.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,20,"Driving up to this place it appeared like what you’d expect from a four points. The lobby, the front desk area were really nice. But you go down the hallway to a bank of 3 elevators.. 2 of which were in disrepair. The part of the hotel they stuck us in was out of a 70’s motel room. Old broken furniture, old carpet, old doors. Housekeeping was knocking on the doors at 9:30pm to clean. Breakfast buffet was $21 each and was something typical of a free buffet offered at a motel 6. Waste of money. Not impressed. Lipstick covered ... you get the drift.","Dear abjardine,Thank you for your honest feedback. We sincerely apologize for falling short of meeting your expectations.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,10,"First I am provided with door keys that didn’t work to the farthest room on the 5th floor. A tremendous walk and wait for an elevator that was the only working one. I had to endure the long walk back and asked to be changed to a room near an elevator as noted in my profile. I was then provided with a room directly over the canopy (entrance). I endured a poorly working ac, an old rickety bed that was so uncomfortable that I was up multiple times throughout the night and finally called it a night at 4am because it was more comfortable to sit in a chair! The room could not be darken because the poor excuse of a shade would not cover all of the light coming in from the entrance. The room was not very clean either; carpets are dirty. Finally, being an Platinum Elite, internet is not to be charged and although they will remove it from my bill, the hassle of having to discuss it should not have to occur. Get it right folks!!! You have over 300 negative Trip Advisor reviews - take the feedback and make corrections! The hotel is perfectly situated down the street from the airport, it has potential, but quite frankly, the alternatives that surround the property appear to be much better.","Hello,We would like to thank you for the effort and time you take in sharing your comments surrounding your experience at our property the Four Points by Sheraton LAX.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,30,"I booked a short stay at the Four Points at Sheraton near LAX recently. The front desk clerks are friendly. The lobby and rooms are clean. There is a timely airport shuttle. However, the elevators call-buttons don’t work well (there is a sign apologizing as they are under construction), I heard loud clanging several times during the evening, breakfast is not complimentary, and the area in general is a food desert in that there aren’t many restaurants within walking distance to buy from. I asked the front desk clerk and she stated that options are mostly this hotel and other nearby hotels (probably averaging $17 per meal). Needless to say, if you are on a fixed budget, I wouldn’t recommend this hotel for this price currently because of the added cost of food, it’s renovation status, and I don’t believe that the current price between $100 and $130 is worth it. In hindsight, I would ask around to other hotels in the area first.","Thank you for taking the time to complete the Guest Satisfaction Survey in regards to your recent stay at the Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport.As we pride ourselves on delivering a memorable hotel experience during your travels, we have unfortunately fallen short of our goal during your recent stay.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,10,"We've used this hotel in the past and always enjoyed our stay. However, this time we were left to stand over 30 minutes in the cold and windy weather at the airport for a hotel shuttle that never came. We gave up and took a taxi. Once at the hotel, we were told that there were plumbing problems and the higher priced room we had reserved was unavailable. We were given a horrible cheaper priced room with no working heat and were told that we would be given a complimentary breakfast as compensation. Upon checking on the breakfast, my husband was told that the complimentary breakfast was the ""free"" coffee in the room. The elevators we used were creaking and rumbling and other guests told us that all the elevators were scary.We were so cold all night that we had to use bath towels on the bed as covers as there was no additional blanket in the room. We will never stay at this hotel again.","I really appreciate you letting us know how your stay with us went. Needless to say I was disappointed to hear that it didn’t go better.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,20,"I work for a company that likes to ""try out"" hotels in each city. Needless to say, of all the airport hotels in LA, this one so far is the worst of the five I've tried. It is a ""tired, dated"" property that feels like it a flash back to the 80's. Clearly the hotel has renovated certain spaces to appear modern but it literally is a dark, depressing property that is working in bits and pieces on how to bring it up to date. Having said that, the rates are not less than the other better properties on the strip.I was checked into a room who clearly had carpets cleaned that same day and after 5 minutes in the room, I was congested and wheezing so requested a change. I got to the second room and similar to the first found a dark room (they use only lamps but have the ""blue white bulbs"" in them that feel like you're in a clinical lab. and it was just awful. I only discovered how much worse it was when I woke up to brush my teeth in the bathroom and there was dried ""vomit"" in the sink. Yes, believe it. I was in a rush so I couldn't change rooms at that time. I ended up moving to a 3rd room and what surprised me was the hotel's attitude as if they were doing me a favour changing my room to something suitable. I told them, they were not. I was staying there for 4 nights...I explained to the hotel supervisor's as much. So disappointing.They have no room service, a dated bar/restaurant and overall the hotel is just not up to par. I would stay in a motel first. Don't waste your money on this one. I would never stay there again.","Thank you for staying with us, we appreciate your business and value you as guest.

Four Points by Sheraton Los Angeles International Airport,10,"I travel a lot and this is one of the worse stays I've had. Let's start with the back elevators. After waiting for minutes for the elevator to arrive, it would stop on every other floor, if not every floor. We were on the 7th so imagine dealing with that all weekend. Then the shower was clogged. Maintenance had to be called so I wouldn't be taking a shower & a bath simultaneously. The arm to to parking gate was malfunctioning & the line would build with people complaining about paying $32/night to park. Breakfast was mediocre, I've had way better. I could go on but I'm done.
