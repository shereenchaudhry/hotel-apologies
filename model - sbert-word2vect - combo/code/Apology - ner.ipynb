      "Dear Mark Stocket,Thank you for taking the time to share your valuable feedback. My name is Emily Perry and I am the Food and Beverage Manager at the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union. It has come to my attention that the service you received during your recent stay did not meet your expectations. I sincerely apologize for the issue you faced while trying to get almond milk for your coffee, I will personally talk to the Bistro attendant who served you that morning and make sure that we are giving out complimentary non-dairy milk just like we are dairy milk. In addition, I apologize for the rate fluctuation you experienced during your stay, the rate depends on the occupancy of the hotel that night so could change around a bit over several nights. I am happy to hear you enjoyed the view of the seaplanes!The experience you described is not characteristic of the level of service our associates strive to provide. I would love the opportunity to hear more about your recent stay in an effort to prevent this issue from occurring in the future.Please let me know the best contact number and time to reach you, or feel free to contact me via phone anytime at 206-403-4340. I look forward to speaking with you in order to restore your confidence in the Courtyard Seattle Downtown/Lake Union.Sincerely,Emily Perry Food and Beverage Manager Courtyard Seattle Downtown/South Lake Unionemily.perry@marriott.com206-403-4340\n",

As you mentioned, the only parking that is affiliated with the hotel is the valet parking. Other options are other parking garages in the immediate area and metered street parking (which is free from 6pm-8am). However, I am happy to hear about the Front Desk staff and that you would stay here again. I will pass on your comments to our Housekeeping Manager and hope you do stay with us again soon.Laura Schles Front Office Manager\n",

It is a fact that when there is damage in the room, a recovery fee is charged. In the case mentioned, it is our responsibility to properly sanitize the mattress in respect to all our future guests that will eventually occupy that room. Besides the cost of the cleaning of the mattress, the room will remain out of service until it is suitable for use again. We understand that accidents happen and we are sorry for the inconvenience but the hotel shouldn't have to absorb the cost of something that is beyond the normal usage of a hotel room.Kind regards,Mauricio Martins Area General Manager\n",

      "Dear Dmempt,Thank you for sharing feedback.We appreciate honesty as it grants us the possibility to understand areas of opportunity and areas of success. I can imagine the frustration with our deposit requirement. At point of check out, our system releases funds but the transition for a bank to accept this action can take days. This is normal for all hotels, but I completely understand your perspective. The deposit is a measure Hotels take for property security as well extending freedom to their patrons in terms of dinning and other available amenities they choose to partake.In relationship to renovations, I am happy to report our building enhancements have been completed. Within a few weeks, all upgrades will be finalized and hope you can visit us again soon. We hope to make it up to you.Should any additional feedback remain you can always contact me at signature below or Hotel directly. We are so deeply appreciative for your comments and wish you all the best.Most Kindly,Ulices Hernandez Front Desk ManagerE: ulices@hielaxairport.com\n",

Our team truly try to go above an beyond for our guests, especially those celebrating a special occasion. Our housekeeping team were addressed on the matter of the prosecco you think went missing from your room and a follow up should have been done that same evening, I believe our Director of Experience has been in contact with you regarding this.Our car service is a very convenient option for our guests as they are readily available. New York City's yellow cabs, licensed by the New York City Taxi & Limousine Commission, offer a flat rate service of $50-$70 from JFK airport to Manhattan as well as anywhere in Manhattan to JFK, excluding tips and tolls. Tips should be around 15-20% of the total price and are common for the good service. Our car service pricing includes the tip as well as the tolls-if you were asked to tip on top of this please inform us as this would not have been correct of the driver and also unusual.Again, we appreciate your feedback and very glad your birthday was a memorable one!Nalini Sullivan General Manager\n",

      "Dear Valued Guest,I am so sorry to hear that your stay was not satisfactory. We do our absolute best to ensure that all of our guests have a pleasant experience and I sorry to hear that we fell short of this on your visit. Although we do honor our commitment to confirm the bed type booked, location of rooms is not guaranteed. Typically our guests prefer rooms away from the boulevard, and we consider our courtyard facing rooms to be on the quieter side. As you mention, we do have a courtyard sitting area for guest who prefer to enjoy breakfast outdoors versus in our breakfast room and this is served from 7am-10am daily. Guestrooms facing this area have blackout drapes to provide privacy.Due to the summer heat wave that Los Angeles experienced recently, air conditioning units have been in full operation by our guests. We inspect these daily to ensure they operate accordingly. Please know that we will make sure to follow up on the items where you feel we have an opportunity to improve. We value your opinion and hope you will reconsider a future stay.Best regards,Maggie Oliva General Manager\n",

      "Hey Brooklyn Mike, thank you for taking the time to share your experience here at Moxy Seattle. Among Marriott's 30 brand choices, the new Moxy brand is quite unique especially with our intentional design to maximize minimal space.Your frustration with improper housekeeping is agreeably disappointing. For this, please accept our sincere apology. We have a simple goal of meeting and exceeding each of our guest's expectations when they choose to stay with us and we obviously failed this goal during your visit.I hope you can reach out to me personally so I can make proper amends as your awesome reviewer name does not give me enough information to find our more detail of contacting you.In addition, I wish I had more control of construction going on in my city, but unless it is happening on my property, we are unfortunately at the mercy of sometimes noisy activity in an amazing developing neighborhood.While I recognize that Moxy may not be the perfect brand for you, I would be happy to offer local knowledge of the 19 Marriott options located within eight miles of our hotel if you come back to Seattle soon.I hope to hear from you soon.Peace.Jerry Stotler Captainjerry.stotler@moxyhotels.com\n",

I'm glad you were able to get such a great deal with our recent Groupon promotion! It's true that the demand in Seattle has made those lower prices hard to come by. Too many people have realized Seattle is such a great place to visit! I can confidently say that we always shop our competitors to stay affordable, but \"affordable\" in July is just nowhere near \"affordable\" in December or January.We were purpose-built from the ground up back in 2001, and regularly \"shop\" around our competitors to see what needs to change, while staying simple and comfortable. I hope you found everything you needed in the room!I'm very sorry you were as irritated as you were by the ventilation system in the bathroom. The machinery on the roof essentially pulls air up to ventilate the bathrooms, and on floors 2-6 it can't be controlled. I imagine (though I'm not certain) you were on the sixth floor. Not everyone is bothered by the white noise, and I wish we had known to have offered you a room on a lower floor. If you stay with us again, please mention this so that we can make sure you're comfortable!Again, thank you so much for your patronage and feedback. I'm glad you enjoyed your time in Seattle, and we would love to host you again.Best Regards,Kelsey Asplund Front Office Manager\n",

We can certainly empathize on how it can be frustrating to arrive earlier than the hotel's designated 4pm check-in time and not have a room ready. We also understand it can also be confusing to observe other travelers checking in before you. This is likely because they had a different room type or category reserved.Here at the Bernic our entire team is dedicated to service and ensuring we are making every effort to take care of our guests. This includes providing early access when available, or storing bags and providing a call as soon as a room is ready. In reviewing your reservation details we see that we were able to get you in a few minutes past 2:30p.We are hopeful you will reconsider your decision and we are afforded the opportunity welcome your return. When planning your visit we encourage you to contact us directly at reservations@thbernichotel.com or 212-754.9700.

      "Dear Sir:Your recent review of The Inn @ St. Botolph on Trip Advisor caught my attention. I truly appreciate your feedback and want to assure you that although your experience was atypical, we are taking appropriate steps to see that it remains so.We appreciate you taking into consideration the fact that we just opened and have some growing pains to overcome. In our effort to create an affordable luxury experience, The Inn @ St. Botolph has limited certain services such as the availability of a valet and parking. While this fact already appears on all confirmations, we are making it more visible and will be providing parking recommendations on our website and in the rooms. We realize that you had difficulty and will be more than happy to cover the cost of your parking ticket if you provide us with a receipt.Each room at The Inn @ St. Botolph is unique, and most are equipped with bathroom shelf space. Unfortunately the delivery of the shower shelving was delayed until after our opening, so guests staying in early November did not have the opportunity to use them. In response to your other suggestions, we are currently working with our designer to provide additional shelf space near the bathroom sink and are completing an in-room directory which will clearly explain how to use our free hard-wired and wireless internet along with a quick reference for trouble shooting.We will soon expand our pillow selection and begin including complimentary coffee packets in each room for those guests who do not wish to avail themselves of the coffee, espresso and cappuccino offered with continental breakfast daily in our lounge. The elevator ring has already been addressed and the in room safes have instructions so guests can utilize them with ease.Lastly and most significantly, there is no excuse for making a guest feel uncomfortable under any circumstance. There is no other remedy than to upgrade our service standards and reinvigorate our staff. Trust that each member of our small but dedicated staff has seen your comments and has been reminded of the role they play in guaranteeing the comfort of our guests.I hope that you will take my assurances to heart and will consider returning to The Inn @ St. Botolph.Kindest Regards,Keith Beardsley Director of Operations\n",

      "Dear Sir:Your recent review of The Inn @ St. Botolph on Trip Advisor caught my attention. I truly appreciate your feedback and want to assure you that although your experience was atypical, we are taking appropriate steps to see that it remains so.We appreciate you taking into consideration the fact that we just opened and have some growing pains to overcome. In our effort to create an affordable luxury experience, The Inn @ St. Botolph has limited certain services such as the availability of a valet and parking. While this fact already appears on all confirmations, we are making it more visible and will be providing parking recommendations on our website and in the rooms. We realize that you had difficulty and will be more than happy to cover the cost of your parking ticket if you provide us with a receipt.Each room at The Inn @ St. Botolph is unique, and most are equipped with bathroom shelf space. Unfortunately the delivery of the shower shelving was delayed until after our opening, so guests staying in early November did not have the opportunity to use them. In response to your other suggestions, we are currently working with our designer to provide additional shelf space near the bathroom sink and are completing an in-room directory which will clearly explain how to use our free hard-wired and wireless internet along with a quick reference for trouble shooting.We will soon expand our pillow selection and begin including complimentary coffee packets in each room for those guests who do not wish to avail themselves of the coffee, espresso and cappuccino offered with continental breakfast daily in our lounge. The elevator ring has already been addressed and the in room safes have instructions so guests can utilize them with ease.Lastly and most significantly, there is no excuse for making a guest feel uncomfortable under any circumstance. There is no other remedy than to upgrade our service standards and reinvigorate our staff. Trust that each member of our small but dedicated staff has seen your comments and has been reminded of the role they play in guaranteeing the comfort of our guests.I hope that you will take my assurances to heart and will consider returning to The Inn @ St. Botolph.Kindest Regards,Keith Beardsley Director of Operations\n",

First of all, please allow us to extend our deepest regrets that we did not live to your expectations; we will try harder in the future. In addressing your concerns we would like to share that our property is in a historic building build in the 1920's. It was certainly not build according to 21-century code regarding insulation and cooling and we are aware of the problems that humidity causes during the summer months. We tried to correct the insulation problem with our gut renovation of this landmark buliding taking additional measures running de-humidifiers during the day. Should any of our guests however reports discomfort we are glad to change the room immediately.As to regards to your other concerns we would like to point that all rooms offer mini fridge/ cooler located in the armoire under the TV. During the dates of your stay Con Ed was reducng power to many customers due to the heat wave and has requested that all users in the city reduce use of power to avoid blackouts/brownouts.Once again we appologize for the inconveniences caused and sincerely hope that you would give us another try in the future.\n",

       " 'Dear happyhourhopper....I am sorry that your experience at our hotel proved so difficult. As it relates to the questions regarding rate, we adhere to an industry leading best available rate program by booking direct with our hotel website. That does not mean that prices do not fluctuate over time for all hotels. If a leader decided to make an adjustment in good faith for a guest, this does not influence pricing on additional rooms, but I am happy to connect with you personally to discuss further at Christy.loy@starwoodhotels.com. Thank you also for making us aware of your concern regarding the elevators during your recent visit. The elevators are designed to respond to the door hold button open button for an extended period or to respond to motion. Our engineering team monitors functionality as part of their daily rounds, but I will certainly make sure they are aware.

That is not the norm.We do offer a complimentary continental breakfast each day (most hotels do not) and 24 hour fresh ground Starbucks coffee and Lipton tea each day in our 4th floor lounge. The machine is rather large and not feasible to have one in each room thus the centralized location. We understand the lounge is rather small with limited seating but provide the fresh fruit, juices. muffins, pastries and bagels with cream cheese on a complimentary basis as we think our guests appreciate the extra value we offer. We know it is far from perfect but are just trying to offer a better value and guests can always take the food back to their rooms with the trays we provide or out with them when going on their day.We were a bit confused by your comment about parking as the hotel does not pay or ever offered to pay for parking at any time. Parking is in a public lot 1 block from the hotel and we are actually able to get our guests a discounted rate of $35 when it would normally cost $50 so it is a 30% savings.Again, our sincere apologies for not meeting your expectations as your experience was not typical and we hope you would be willing to give us another chance.

Our hotel building, built in the 1920s does have that old-timey architecture on most of our floors, leading to some very cozy-sized rooms. With that struggle that we have here at the Courtyard Boston Downtown, we do our best to boast the beautiful spaces accessible to all of our guests, including our 15th floor lounge space with complimentary water, our Elk's Room located right by the main entrance to our lobby, and our 5th floor event areas.While we do encourage these spaces, I can still understand how our cozy rooms do not appeal to everyone. I do hope that we can have the chance to impress you in the future, there are other rooms in our hotel that would have some more space to your liking. If you are not opposed to a room with 2 beds, we have wonderful corner rooms with more space, and we also have our 15th floor executive level, where all of the rooms are of a more recent construction than the 1920s rooms that we have on the floors below it. The next time you would like to stay in Boston, please consider us again and I will be happy to give you a complementary upgrade to one of these rooms. Just reach out to me whenever you book with us next.With Warm Regards,Cristina M\",\n",

As I mentioned on your Expedia review - We have 3 parking garages and from what I read you've had a tall Suv that would not fit in our 2 main garages that charge $25. Our 3rd garage which is a few block away from us accommodates Suv's and pick up trucks from 6ft to 6fi 5in tall. They do charge us $40 and that's what we charge our guest. continually try to do our very best for all of our guests, but unfortunately, sometimes we do fail.We thank you again for your feedback and we hope you would give us another change if travels bring you back to Chicago.Sincerely,Roxana DMajestic Hotel\",\n",

I\\'m glad you were able to get such a great deal with our recent Groupon promotion! It\\'s true that the demand in Seattle has made those lower prices hard to come by. Too many people have realized Seattle is such a great place to visit! I can confidently say that we always shop our competitors to stay affordable, but \"affordable\" in July is just nowhere near \"affordable\" in December or January.We were purpose-built from the ground up back in 2001, and regularly \"shop\" around our competitors to see what needs to change, while staying simple and comfortable. I hope you found everything you needed in the room!I\\'m very sorry you were as irritated as you were by the ventilation system in the bathroom. The machinery on the roof essentially pulls air up to ventilate the bathrooms, and on floors 2-6 it can\\'t be controlled. I imagine (though I\\'m not certain) you were on the sixth floor. Not everyone is bothered by the white noise, and I wish we had known to have offered you a room on a lower floor. If you stay with us again, please mention this so that we can make sure you\\'re comfortable!Again, thank you so much for your patronage and feedback.

We are working on installing brand new air conditioning and heating units so hopefully this will help if you decide to give us another try in the future. And yes we do have bottled water in the minibar for purchase but of course if any of our guests are experiencing an issue such as you had; we will certainly do everything possible to remedy the situation without an added expense. We do have a wonderful ocean breeze here in Santa Monica, and that can leave a scent that some adore and some may not, which is why we have the option of an atomizer in the room, I am sorry that yours did not seem to work but again a quick call to alert our helpful and friendly staff and we would replace that right away as we have plenty of extra on hand.We do have some adjoining rooms with connecting doors and those doors are locked at all times and can only be opened by a front desk agent with a key, no guest can ever open those doors, I understand your concern with this but I can assure you they are completely safe and secure.And I am glad you received our wonderful welcome note that lets guests know about some of the wonderful features and amenities that we provide here at Palihouse and as you mentioned we do have some idiosyncrasies, being a historical landmark building we feel as most of our guests do that it only adds to the charm, it in no way indicates that we are here to give anything less than the best service possible when a guest calls the desk for assistance. I am really sorry to hear that you did not reach out to us with these concerns during your stay and allowed us the opportunity to address these issues for you to assure you had a wonderful experience, that being said I hope I was able to address your concerns and I do hope you will consider giving us another try if decide to visit beautiful Santa Monica again.Best,Greg Shortt | Housemaster',\n",

We also offer Dinner service from 1212 restaurant in Santa Monica. Additionally we offer our hotel guests a free continental breakfast served in the lobby on Saturdays and Sundays, which our guests just love and of course room service, so we do have a lot of dining options.

Regarding the strange smell in the room, occasionally the warm ocean breezes in Santa Monica can be mistaken as ‚Äúmusty‚Äù so we have equipped each room with an aroma diffuser that guests are welcome to use at anytime. As you can see from all of our 5 star reviews your experience is highly unusual, perhaps the allergies were trigged by an outside side source of vegetation which would be more understandable. I hope you found more suitable accommodations for the remainder of your stay in Santa Monica.Best,Greg Shortt | Housemaster',\n",

I truly appreciate your feedback and want to assure you that although your experience was atypical, we are taking appropriate steps to see that it remains so.We appreciate you taking into consideration the fact that we just opened and have some growing pains to overcome. In our effort to create an affordable luxury experience, The Inn @ St. Botolph has limited certain services such as the availability of a valet and parking. While this fact already appears on all confirmations, we are making it more visible and will be providing parking recommendations on our website and in the rooms. We realize that you had difficulty and will be more than happy to cover the cost of your parking ticket if you provide us with a receipt.Each room at The Inn @ St. Botolph is unique, and most are equipped with bathroom shelf space. Unfortunately the delivery of the shower shelving was delayed until after our opening, so guests staying in early November did not have the opportunity to use them. In response to your other suggestions, we are currently working with our designer to provide additional shelf space near the bathroom sink and are completing an in-room directory which will clearly explain how to use our free hard-wired and wireless internet along with a quick reference for trouble shooting.We will soon expand our pillow selection and begin including complimentary coffee packets in each room for those guests who do not wish to avail themselves of the coffee, espresso and cappuccino offered with continental breakfast daily in our lounge. The elevator ring has already been addressed and the in room safes have instructions so guests can utilize them with ease.Lastly and most significantly, there is no excuse for making a guest feel uncomfortable under any circumstance. There is no other remedy than to upgrade our service standards and reinvigorate our staff. Trust that each member of our small but dedicated staff has seen your comments and has been reminded of the role they play in guaranteeing the comfort of our guests.I hope that you will take my assurances to heart and will consider returning to The Inn @ St. Botolph.Kindest Regards,Keith Beardsley Director of Operations',\n",

That is not the norm.We do offer a complimentary continental breakfast each day (most hotels do not) and 24 hour fresh ground Starbucks coffee and Lipton tea each day in our 4th floor lounge. The machine is rather large and not feasible to have one in each room thus the centralized location. We understand the lounge is rather small with limited seating but provide the fresh fruit, juices. muffins, pastries and bagels with cream cheese on a complimentary basis as we think our guests appreciate the extra value we offer. We know it is far from perfect but are just trying to offer a better value and guests can always take the food back to their rooms with the trays we provide or out with them when going on their day.We were a bit confused by your comment about parking as the hotel does not pay or ever offered to pay for parking at any time. Parking is in a public lot 1 block from the hotel and we are actually able to get our guests a discounted rate of $35 when it would normally cost $50 so it is a 30% savings.Again, our sincere apologies for not meeting your expectations as your experience was not typical and we hope you would be willing to give us another chance.

       " \"Dear Maserk,Thank you for taking the time to fill out our survey. Your honest opinion goes a long way into helping us improve ourselves so that we can better care for our cherished guests. Our hotel building, built in the 1920s does have that old-timey architecture on most of our floors, leading to some very cozy-sized rooms. With that struggle that we have here at the Courtyard Boston Downtown, we do our best to boast the beautiful spaces accessible to all of our guests, including our 15th floor lounge space with complimentary water, our Elk's Room located right by the main entrance to our lobby, and our 5th floor event areas.While we do encourage these spaces, I can still understand how our cozy rooms do not appeal to everyone. I do hope that we can have the chance to impress you in the future, there are other rooms in our hotel that would have some more space to your liking. If you are not opposed to a room with 2 beds, we have wonderful corner rooms with more space, and we also have our 15th floor executive level, where all of the rooms are of a more recent construction than the 1920s rooms that we have on the floors below it. The next time you would like to stay in Boston, please consider us again and I will be happy to give you a complementary upgrade to one of these rooms. Just reach out to me whenever you book with us next.With Warm Regards,Cristina M\",\n",
       " \"Thank you for taking the time to share your experience with us. It's never easy to read when a guests stay has been anything other than perfect. Unfortunately if you were not able to acquire the correct number of points required to stay with us, despite being emailed ahead of time, at property level we are left with the need to charge the prevailing rate of the day for the reservation. In these instances, we very much hope that the guest will communicate with us prior to arrival so that we may take steps to help however we can to get your reservation set up the way you prefer, offering the opportunity to purchase whatever points may be needed to satisfy the full stay ahead of time, so that a higher rate can be avoided. Given that the night you had opted to use your points happened to coincide with a Stanley Cup play off game, demand and rates became high across the city and the prevailing rate was not what you had expected. We hope to be able to discuss this further with you at a time of your convenience by telephone or email and would kindly ask that you reach out directly.\",\n",

Being that we are an historic building, we do not have a parking garage in the hotel so we must lease garage space on the next block, hence the valet only option. Parking is at a premium in all of downtown Seattle, so I always encourage guests to use public transportation if they can do without a car while visiting.

When we in fact did our cross examination there were no bed bugs found in the room, the bugs found while you were in the room were cancelled out from being bed bugs the second the examination started. Regardless of that we understood your frustration and Diana did offer a free night in points which could've been used for a room at the Embassy suites. In regards to the airplane noise, we are an airport hotel located right next to the airport.

Not sure what you are referring to for the \"dental kit.\" We have toothbrushes and toothpaste available for free at the front desk. All you need do is ask.2. Our wifi speed is 200mps up and down which exceeds by the brand standard by 100mps.3. There are Keurig coffeemakers in each room with a nice selection of coffees and teas and plain hot water should you like that option.4. As you can see from every other review, our staff offers the best in guest service. I would appreciate you letting me know to whom you are specifically referring to from our staff.a. As with all Holiday Inns, breakfast is not included in the rate. We do have a breakfast package which allows you to purchase at time of booking at a reduced price.b. Not sure about this, so more details are needed.c. Fridges are not standard with Holiday Inns. We do however have some available for a small fee.

       " 'Dear Vee33 Mag,Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica, I am sorry to hear that you did not have the best experience with us here. I understand that you found the heating in the room to be too warm but a simple call to the front desk and we would have been more than happy to have taken care of this for you. We are working on installing brand new air conditioning and heating units so hopefully this will help if you decide to give us another try in the future. And yes we do have bottled water in the minibar for purchase but of course if any of our guests are experiencing an issue such as you had; we will certainly do everything possible to remedy the situation without an added expense. We do have a wonderful ocean breeze here in Santa Monica, and that can leave a scent that some adore and some may not, which is why we have the option of an atomizer in the room, I am sorry that yours did not seem to work but again a quick call to alert our helpful and friendly staff and we would replace that right away as we have plenty of extra on hand.We do have some adjoining rooms with connecting doors and those doors are locked at all times and can only be opened by a front desk agent with a key, no guest can ever open those doors, I understand your concern with this but I can assure you they are completely safe and secure.And I am glad you received our wonderful welcome note that lets guests know about some of the wonderful features and amenities that we provide here at Palihouse and as you mentioned we do have some idiosyncrasies, being a historical landmark building we feel as most of our guests do that it only adds to the charm, it in no way indicates that we are here to give anything less than the best service possible when a guest calls the desk for assistance. I am really sorry to hear that you did not reach out to us with these concerns during your stay and allowed us the opportunity to address these issues for you to assure you had a wonderful experience, that being said I hope I was able to address your concerns and I do hope you will consider giving us another try if decide to visit beautiful Santa Monica again.Best,Greg Shortt | Housemaster',\n",

I am happy to hear that you had a nice stay, however I am disappointed to hear about your concerns regarding the breakfast and restaurant options as we have a full restaurant in the hotel which serves breakfast and lunch in the lobby and both outside courtyards. We also offer Dinner service from 1212 restaurant in Santa Monica. Additionally we offer our hotel guests a free continental breakfast served in the lobby on Saturdays and Sundays, which our guests just love and of course room service, so we do have a lot of dining options. I am sorry for the confusion or if this was not explained to you properly when you were here staying with us. We would love to welcome you back and have you try some of our delicious local produce by Paligroup Executive Chef, Kris Tominaga.Best,Greg Shortt | Housemaster',\n",

Regarding the strange smell in the room, occasionally the warm ocean breezes in Santa Monica can be mistaken as ‚Äúmusty‚Äù so we have equipped each room with an aroma diffuser that guests are welcome to use at anytime. As you can see from all of our 5 star reviews your experience is highly unusual, perhaps the allergies were trigged by an outside side source of vegetation which would be more understandable. I hope you found more suitable accommodations for the remainder of your stay in Santa Monica.Best,Greg Shortt | Housemaster',\n",

If a member of my staff was curt with you, that is unacceptable and I sincerly apologize.For most of our guests, the tread mill, bike, eliptical machine and free weights are adequate for their workout needs. For a 16 room hotel, I feel that our gym is appropriately sized to meet our guest needs, and if a traveler needs something more extensive, there are several full sized gyms in close vacinity to the hotel.Our breakfast includes Bagels, english muffins, three different kinds of Nutrigrain bars, three different kinds of oatmeal, Yoplait Yogurt, Nepresso Coffee, Twinings Teas, Apple+Orange+Cranberry+V8 juices. In the Nespresso Machine we have 1% milk.Once again, I apologize that we did not meet your expectations, and I hope that you will consider us again the next time that you are in Boston.Best Regards,Tom De SistoGeneral Manager EMAIL617-236-8099',\n",
       " 'Dear Sir:Your recent review of The Inn @ St. Botolph on Trip Advisor caught my attention. I truly appreciate your feedback and want to assure you that although your experience was atypical, we are taking appropriate steps to see that it remains so.We appreciate you taking into consideration the fact that we just opened and have some growing pains to overcome. In our effort to create an affordable luxury experience, The Inn @ St. Botolph has limited certain services such as the availability of a valet and parking. While this fact already appears on all confirmations, we are making it more visible and will be providing parking recommendations on our website and in the rooms. We realize that you had difficulty and will be more than happy to cover the cost of your parking ticket if you provide us with a receipt.Each room at The Inn @ St. Botolph is unique, and most are equipped with bathroom shelf space. Unfortunately the delivery of the shower shelving was delayed until after our opening, so guests staying in early November did not have the opportunity to use them. In response to your other suggestions, we are currently working with our designer to provide additional shelf space near the bathroom sink and are completing an in-room directory which will clearly explain how to use our free hard-wired and wireless internet along with a quick reference for trouble shooting.We will soon expand our pillow selection and begin including complimentary coffee packets in each room for those guests who do not wish to avail themselves of the coffee, espresso and cappuccino offered with continental breakfast daily in our lounge. The elevator ring has already been addressed and the in room safes have instructions so guests can utilize them with ease.Lastly and most significantly, there is no excuse for making a guest feel uncomfortable under any circumstance. There is no other remedy than to upgrade our service standards and reinvigorate our staff. Trust that each member of our small but dedicated staff has seen your comments and has been reminded of the role they play in guaranteeing the comfort of our guests.I hope that you will take my assurances to heart and will consider returning to The Inn @ St. Botolph.Kindest Regards,Keith Beardsley Director of Operations',\n",

That is not the norm. We do offer a complimentary continental breakfast each day (most hotels do not) and 24 hour fresh ground Starbucks coffee and Lipton tea each day in our 4th floor lounge.  The machine is rather large and not feasible to have one in each room thus the centralized location.  We understand the lounge is rather small with limited seating but provide the fresh fruit,  juices.  muffins,  pastries and bagels with cream cheese on a complimentary basis as we think our guests appreciate the extra value we offer.  We know it is far from perfect but are just trying to offer a better value and guests can always take the food back to their rooms with the trays we provide or out with them when going on their day. We were a bit confused by your comment about parking as the hotel does not pay or ever offered to pay for parking at any time.  Parking is in a public lot 1 block from the hotel and we are actually able to get our guests a discounted rate of $35 when it would normally cost $50 so it is a 30% savings.

Your honest opinion goes a long way into helping us improve ourselves so that we can better care for our cherished guests.  Our hotel building,  built in the 1920s does have that old-timey architecture on most of our floors,  leading to some very cozy-sized rooms.  With that struggle that we have here at the Courtyard Boston Downtown,  we do our best to boast the beautiful spaces accessible to all of our guests,  including our 15th floor lounge space with complimentary water,  our Elk's Room located right by the main entrance to our lobby,  and our 5th floor event areas. While we do encourage these spaces,  I can still understand how our cozy rooms do not appeal to everyone.  I do hope that we can have the chance to impress you in the future,  there are other rooms in our hotel that would have some more space to your liking.  If you are not opposed to a room with 2 beds,  we have wonderful corner rooms with more space,  and we also have our 15th floor executive level,  where all of the rooms are of a more recent construction than the 1920s rooms that we have on the floors below it.

I am glad you found them comfortable.  Our rates fluctuate seasonally with the demand in the market.  Generally our rates are lower than most others in downtown Seattle.  Being that we are an historic building,  we do not have a parking garage in the hotel so we must lease garage space on the next block,  hence the valet only option.  Parking is at a premium in all of downtown Seattle,  so I always encourage guests to use public transportation if they can do without a car while visiting.  I sincerely apologize for the view from your room.  The rooms on that side of the building face another brick building and therefore obscure any city view from that side on the lower floors.

As Diana explained to you upon your complaint,  we have never experienced bed bugs in our hotel and we did need to perform a cross examination with our pest department to evaluate if the bugs found in your room were in fact bed bugs.  When we in fact did our cross examination there were no bed bugs found in the room,  the bugs found while you were in the room were cancelled out from being bed bugs the second the examination started.  Regardless of that we understood your frustration and Diana did offer a free night in points which could've been used for a room at the Embassy suites.  In regards to the airplane noise,  we are an airport hotel located right next to the airport.

Please allow me to respond to each of your commetns and then you decide if this is the correct hotel as there is another Holiday Inn and a Holiday Inn Express on Wall Street not far from here.  We are often confused with those hotels. 1.  Our bathroom amenities are from Bath & Body Works and of the some of the best quality.  Not sure what you are referring to for the \"dental kit. \" We have toothbrushes and toothpaste available for free at the front desk.  All you need do is ask. 2.  Our wifi speed is 200mps up and down which exceeds by the brand standard by 100mps. 3.  There are Keurig coffeemakers in each room with a nice selection of coffees and teas and plain hot water should you like that option. 4.  As you can see from every other review,  our staff offers the best in guest service.  I would appreciate you letting me know to whom you are specifically referring to from our staff. a.  As with all Holiday Inns,  breakfast is not included in the rate.  We do have a breakfast package which allows you to purchase at time of booking at a reduced price. b.  Not sure about this,  so more details are needed. c.  Fridges are not standard with Holiday Inns.  We do however have some available for a small fee.  All you need do is ask. Again,  as you can see none of this makes sense,  so I ask you to verify that you had the correct hotel.  I am not disputing any of your comments,  but feel that you have the wrong property. If so,  then please allow me to make this right for you.

       " 'Dear Vee33 Mag, Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica,  I am sorry to hear that you did not have the best experience with us here.  I understand that you found the heating in the room to be too warm but a simple call to the front desk and we would have been more than happy to have taken care of this for you.  We are working on installing brand new air conditioning and heating units so hopefully this will help if you decide to give us another try in the future.  And yes we do have bottled water in the minibar for purchase but of course if any of our guests are experiencing an issue such as you had; we will certainly do everything possible to remedy the situation without an added expense.  We do have a wonderful ocean breeze here in Santa Monica,  and that can leave a scent that some adore and some may not,  which is why we have the option of an atomizer in the room,  I am sorry that yours did not seem to work but again a quick call to alert our helpful and friendly staff and we would replace that right away as we have plenty of extra on hand. We do have some adjoining rooms with connecting doors and those doors are locked at all times and can only be opened by a front desk agent with a key,  no guest can ever open those doors,  I understand your concern with this but I can assure you they are completely safe and secure. And I am glad you received our wonderful welcome note that lets guests know about some of the wonderful features and amenities that we provide here at Palihouse and as you mentioned we do have some idiosyncrasies,  being a historical landmark building we feel as most of our guests do that it only adds to the charm,  it in no way indicates that we are here to give anything less than the best service possible when a guest calls the desk for assistance.  I am really sorry to hear that you did not reach out to us with these concerns during your stay and allowed us the opportunity to address these issues for you to assure you had a wonderful experience,  that being said I hope I was able to address your concerns and I do hope you will consider giving us another try if decide to visit beautiful Santa Monica again. Best, Greg Shortt | Housemaster',\n",
       " 'Dear Joannemaxcy, Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica.  I am happy to hear that you had a nice stay,  however I am disappointed to hear about your concerns regarding the breakfast and restaurant options as we have a full restaurant in the hotel which serves breakfast and lunch in the lobby and both outside courtyards.  We also offer Dinner service from 1212 restaurant in Santa Monica.  Additionally we offer our hotel guests a free continental breakfast served in the lobby on Saturdays and Sundays,  which our guests just love and of course room service,  so we do have a lot of dining options.  I am sorry for the confusion or if this was not explained to you properly when you were here staying with us.  We would love to welcome you back and have you try some of our delicious local produce by Paligroup Executive Chef,  Kris Tominaga. Best, Greg Shortt | Housemaster',\n",
       " 'Dear Ching W, Thank you for your review of Palihouse Santa Monica,  I am sorry to hear that you suffered from allergies while you were here,  however I can assure that our wonderful indoor carpeting is new carpet (not old),  and is thoroughly vacuumed daily and steam cleaned on a regular basis.  Regarding the strange smell in the room,  occasionally the warm ocean breezes in Santa Monica can be mistaken as ‚Äúmusty‚Äù so we have equipped each room with an aroma diffuser that guests are welcome to use at anytime.  As you can see from all of our 5 star reviews your experience is highly unusual,  perhaps the allergies were trigged by an outside side source of vegetation which would be more understandable.  I hope you found more suitable accommodations for the remainder of your stay in Santa Monica. Best, Greg Shortt | Housemaster',\n",

The reason for our no smoking policy is to to keep the hotel and guestrooms free of any residual odor as well as not to trouble those who are occupying neighboring rooms,  guests with asthma that may be affected,  and also the next guests checking into that room which we promote as smoke-free.  We value to the safety and comfort of our guests which is why we do have to enforce this policy.  After having sent a letter of notification asking as a reminder of the policy,  the inaction then lead the property in having to enforce the non-smoking policy acknowledged and signed for at check in.

Most of our guests find our guestroom lighting to be appropriate,  and our staff to be friendly and courteous.

       " 'Dear Sir:Your recent review of The Inn @ St.  Botolph on Trip Advisor caught my attention.  I truly appreciate your feedback and want to assure you that although your experience was atypical,  we are taking appropriate steps to see that it remains so. We appreciate you taking into consideration the fact that we just opened and have some growing pains to overcome.  In our effort to create an affordable luxury experience,  The Inn @ St.  Botolph has limited certain services such as the availability of a valet and parking.  While this fact already appears on all confirmations,  we are making it more visible and will be providing parking recommendations on our website and in the rooms.  We realize that you had difficulty and will be more than happy to cover the cost of your parking ticket if you provide us with a receipt. Each room at The Inn @ St.  Botolph is unique,  and most are equipped with bathroom shelf space.  Unfortunately the delivery of the shower shelving was delayed until after our opening,  so guests staying in early November did not have the opportunity to use them.  In response to your other suggestions,  we are currently working with our designer to provide additional shelf space near the bathroom sink and are completing an in-room directory which will clearly explain how to use our free hard-wired and wireless internet along with a quick reference for trouble shooting. We will soon expand our pillow selection and begin including complimentary coffee packets in each room for those guests who do not wish to avail themselves of the coffee,  espresso and cappuccino offered with continental breakfast daily in our lounge.  The elevator ring has already been addressed and the in room safes have instructions so guests can utilize them with ease. Lastly and most significantly,  there is no excuse for making a guest feel uncomfortable under any circumstance.  There is no other remedy than to upgrade our service standards and reinvigorate our staff.  Trust that each member of our small but dedicated staff has seen your comments and has been reminded of the role they play in guaranteeing the comfort of our guests. I hope that you will take my assurances to heart and will consider returning to The Inn @ St.  Botolph. Kindest Regards, Keith Beardsley Director of Operations',\n",

       " 'Dear Vee33 Mag, Thank you for your review of ORG,  I am sorry to hear that you did not have the best experience with us here.  I understand that you found the heating in the room to be too warm but a simple call to the front desk and we would have been more than happy to have taken care of this for you.  We are working on installing brand new air conditioning and heating units so hopefully this will help if you decide to give us another try in the future.  And yes we do have bottled water in the minibar for purchase but of course if any of our guests are experiencing an issue such as you had; we will certainly do everything possible to remedy the situation without an added expense.  We do have a wonderful ocean breeze here in GPE,  and that can leave a scent that some adore and some may not,  which is why we have the option of an atomizer in the room,  I am sorry that yours did not seem to work but again a quick call to alert our helpful and friendly staff and we would replace that right away as we have plenty of extra on hand. We do have some adjoining rooms with connecting doors and those doors are locked at all times and can only be opened by a front desk agent with a key,  no guest can ever open those doors,  I understand your concern with this but I can assure you they are completely safe and secure. And I am glad you received our wonderful welcome note that lets guests know about some of the wonderful features and amenities that we provide here at Palihouse and as you mentioned we do have some idiosyncrasies,  being a historical landmark building we feel as most of our guests do that it only adds to the charm,  it in no way indicates that we are here to give anything less than the best service possible when a guest calls the desk for assistance.  I am really sorry to hear that you did not reach out to us with these concerns during your stay and allowed us the opportunity to address these issues for you to assure you had a wonderful experience,  that being said I hope I was able to address your concerns and I do hope you will consider giving us another try if decide to visit beautiful GPE again.

       " 'Dear Sir:Your recent review of FACGPE on ORG caught my attention.  I truly appreciate your feedback and want to assure you that although your experience was atypical,  we are taking appropriate steps to see that it remains so. We appreciate you taking into consideration the fact that we just opened and have some growing pains to overcome.  In our effort to create an affordable luxury experience,  FACGPE has limited certain services such as the availability of a valet and parking.  While this fact already appears on all confirmations,  we are making it more visible and will be providing parking recommendations on our website and in the rooms.  We realize that you had difficulty and will be more than happy to cover the cost of your parking ticket if you provide us with a receipt. Each room at FACGPE is unique,  and most are equipped with bathroom shelf space.  Unfortunately the delivery of the shower shelving was delayed until after our opening,  so guests staying in DATE did not have the opportunity to use them.  In response to your other suggestions,  we are currently working with our designer to provide additional shelf space near the bathroom sink and are completing an in-room directory which will clearly explain how to use our free hard-wired and wireless internet along with a quick reference for trouble shooting. We will soon expand our pillow selection and begin including complimentary coffee packets in each room for those guests who do not wish to avail themselves of the coffee,  espresso and cappuccino offered with continental breakfast DATE in our lounge.  The elevator ring has already been addressed and the in room safes have instructions so guests can utilize them with ease. Lastly and most significantly,  there is no excuse for making a guest feel uncomfortable under any circumstance.  There is no other remedy than to upgrade our service standards and reinvigorate our staff.  Trust that each member of our small but dedicated staff has seen your comments and has been reminded of the role they play in guaranteeing the comfort of our guests. I hope that you will take my assurances to heart and will consider returning to FACGPE. PERSON, PERSON Director of ORG',\n",

Not only is our desk always happy to help,  but CARDINAL associate specifically asking if you needed help with finding restaurants or travel directions and you declined.  We offer the ORG as a unique business center option as space is limited in our lobby (as you mentiCARDINALd).  Most guests find them very easy to use and I‚Äôm sorry you were unable to print on them as they do print wirelessly to the front desk.  I find it difficult to read the comments about our staff service as almost every guest makes a point to recognize how refreshing it is to find a cozy,  affordable hotel that offers outstanding personalized service.  Every staff member is personally selected and trained to go out of his or her way to assist all guests.  I am glad that the comfort of our mattresses was the silver lining in your stay and I assure you that the in-room appliances are top notch in commercial options.  I wish you the best in future travel plans and hope your family and friends back in the LOC area are safe and healthy. \",\n",
       " 'PERSON B:On behalf of the management and staff,  I would like to apologize for the severe inconsistencies in service you experienced during your stay with us.
